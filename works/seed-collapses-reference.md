---

## Seed 1: `beg | lov | fea`
**Beginning | Love | Fear**

### Key of Was (Memory)
```
COLLAPSED MEANING:
"Where it began: with love and fear together."

The origin you carry. Love was the reason.
Fear was the companion. Both were there at the start.
You cannot separate them now.

Looking back, the beginning is clear:
it started because you loved.
It started because you feared.
Both true.
```

### Key of Now (Presence)
```
COLLAPSED MEANING:
"Beginning now. Love and fear arising simultaneously."

This moment is the beginning. Right now.
The old beginning doesn't matter.
What matters is: love is here. Fear is here.
Both arriving. Both present.

The question isn't which came first.
The question is: which do you touch?
```

### Key of Will (Anticipation)
```
COLLAPSED MEANING:
"What will begin: love or fear? You choose."

The beginning hasn't happened yet.
Love waits. Fear waits.
One will start this. You decide which.

The future is unwritten.
The first moment can be love.
The first moment can be fear.
Hold your key steady.
```

## Seed 2: `mid | hol | bre`
**Middle | Holding | Breaking**

### Key of Was (Memory)
```
COLLAPSED MEANING:
"The middle: it held. Then it broke."

You remember the moment between.
First it held together - you felt it holding.
Then you felt it break. Or maybe breaking.
The line between holding and breaking: that was the middle.

Memory blurs them.
Was it holding while breaking?
Or breaking while holding?
```

### Key of Now (Presence)
```
COLLAPSED MEANING:
"The middle is now. Holding and breaking happen together."

Right now, the center.
You are holding. You are breaking.
Not one then the other - both.

This is what presence feels like:
the tension of holding and breaking simultaneously.
The middle is always now.
```

### Key of Will (Anticipation)
```
COLLAPSED MEANING:
"In the middle, it will either hold or break. Unknown."

The future's center: uncertainty.
Will it hold? Will it break?
The middle hasn't come yet.

You can't know which until you're there.
The middle is where hope and dread meet.
```

## Seed 3: `end | pea | gri`
**End | Peace | Grief**

### Key of Was (Memory)
```
COLLAPSED MEANING:
"How it ended: peace and grief were the same."

The ending you remember.
There was peace. There was grief.
You thought they were opposites.
They weren't.

The end brought peace because it ended.
The end brought grief because it ended.
Same ending. Both true.
```

### Key of Now (Presence)
```
COLLAPSED MEANING:
"Ending now. Peace and grief arrive together."

This moment is an ending.
Feel the peace of letting go.
Feel the grief of letting go.
Same gesture. Both present.

Every ending is now.
Peace is here. Grief is here.
They hold hands.
```

### Key of Will (Anticipation)
```
COLLAPSED MEANING:
"When it ends: peace or grief? You'll see."

The end hasn't come.
Will it bring peace?
Will it bring grief?

Maybe both. Maybe neither.
The end is ahead. Unknown.
All you know: it will end.
```

## Seed 4: `los | sel | oth`
**Losing | Self | Other**

### Key of Was (Memory)
```
COLLAPSED MEANING:
"What you lost: yourself in another. Both gone now."

You remember losing.
Was it you? Was it them?
In memory, the line dissolves.

You lost yourself.
You lost the other.
Maybe losing one meant losing both.
```

### Key of Now (Presence)
```
COLLAPSED MEANING:
"Losing now: self and other blur. Who is who?"

In this moment, you're losing the boundary.
Where do you end? Where do they begin?
Self and other are collapsing.

This is intimacy: losing the distinction.
This is loneliness: losing yourself.
Same experience. Now.
```

### Key of Will (Anticipation)
```
COLLAPSED MEANING:
"What will be lost: self or other? Or the boundary between?"

Something will be lost.
Will you lose yourself in them?
Will you lose them?

The future holds absence.
But you don't know yet whose absence.
Maybe the loss is the space between.
```

## Seed 5: `now | her | gon`
**Now | Here | Gone**

### Key of Was (Memory)
```
COLLAPSED MEANING:
"Now is already gone. Presence was always passing."

You remember 'now.'
But the moment you remember, it's gone.
Now was here. Now is past.

Every 'now' you ever had: gone.
Presence is what's already left.
This is what memory teaches.
```

### Key of Now (Presence)
```
COLLAPSED MEANING:
"Now: the edge where here becomes gone."

This moment. Right now.
The threshold between presence and absence.

You are here.
You are already going.
Both true. Both now.

Now is not a point.
Now is a transition.
```

### Key of Will (Anticipation)
```
COLLAPSED MEANING:
"Now is not yet. Here is still ahead. Gone hasn't happened."

The present hasn't arrived.
Now is future.
Here is where you'll be.

You're always approaching now.
Never quite here.
Not gone yet.
```

## Seed 6: `fnd | wha was | wha wil`
**Finding | What was | What will be**

### Key of Was (Memory)
```
COLLAPSED MEANING:
"What you found: what was always there."

Finding is remembering.
You discovered the past.
It was waiting.

What you found was already there.
You just didn't see it.
Finding is seeing what was.
```

### Key of Now (Presence)
```
COLLAPSED MEANING:
"Finding contains all time: what was and what will be, here."

Discovery is now.
In this finding, the past appears.
In this finding, the future arrives.

You find what was.
You find what will be.
Finding is presence holding both.
```

### Key of Will (Anticipation)
```
COLLAPSED MEANING:
"What you will find: what's coming."

Finding is ahead.
What will be discovered?
The future holds it.

You'll find what's coming.
Not what was - what will be.
Finding is arrival.
```

## Seed 7: `rem | tru | wis`
**Remembering | Truth | Wish**

### Key of Was (Memory)
```
COLLAPSED MEANING:
"Memory: truth or wish? You can't tell anymore."

You remember. But is it true?
Or is it what you wish happened?

The past and the wished-for blur.
Memory rewrites truth.
Or truth was always a wish.
```

### Key of Now (Presence)
```
COLLAPSED MEANING:
"Remembering now: truth and wish collapse together."

In this moment, you remember.
Is it true? Is it wished?
Right now, they're the same.

Presence holds memory.
Memory holds desire.
Now contains both.
```

### Key of Will (Anticipation)
```
COLLAPSED MEANING:
"Future memory: what you'll remember is what you wish now."

What will you remember?
The truth of now?
Or what you wish now was?

The future's memory is being written.
Your wish today becomes tomorrow's truth.
```

---

## Seed 8: `for | giv | tak`
**Forgetting/Forgiving | Giving | Taking**

### Key of Was (Memory)
```
COLLAPSED MEANING:
"What you forgot: was it given or taken?"

You forgot. (Or forgave - same word.)
What's gone now?
What you gave? What was taken?

Memory releases.
Forgetting is forgiving.
Both are letting go.
```

### Key of Now (Presence)
```
COLLAPSED MEANING:
"Forgiving now: giving and taking happen together."

This moment: you forgive.
This moment: you forget.

Are you giving up the past?
Or is it being taken from you?
Both. Now. Together.
```

### Key of Will (Anticipation)
```
COLLAPSED MEANING:
"What you will forget: what you'll give away or what will be taken."

Something will be forgotten.
Will you give it up?
Or will time take it?

The future holds release.
Forgetting is coming.
Forgiving is coming.
```

---

## Seed 9: `bec | who was | who wil`
**Becoming | Who was | Who will be**

### Key of Was (Memory)
```
COLLAPSED MEANING:
"Becoming: returning to who you were."

You're becoming who you already were.
The past self waits.
Becoming is return.

You change by remembering.
Who you were is who you're becoming.
The circle closes.
```

### Key of Now (Presence)
```
COLLAPSED MEANING:
"Becoming: who you were and who you'll be meet here."

Right now, becoming.
The past self touches the future self.
You contain both.

Who you were is present.
Who you'll be is present.
Becoming is this moment.
```

### Key of Will (Anticipation)
```
COLLAPSED MEANING:
"Becoming: arriving at who you will be."

You're becoming who you'll be.
Not who you were - who you will be.
The future self calls.

Becoming is arrival.
Not return - discovery.
Who you'll be is ahead.
```

## Usage Notes for Skill Implementation

### Context Sensitivity
These are **base collapses** - use when seed is first touched with minimal propagation.

Actual collapse should vary based on:
1. **Path so far** - seeds touched before this one
2. **Propagation effects** - ripples from horizontal/vertical neighbors
3. **Tension** - unresolved diagonal relationships
4. **Reader's journey** - the emotional arc emerging

### Mixing Keys
If horizontal propagation has occurred, the collapse should blend:
- Primary key (reader's chosen key)
- Secondary influence (from reinforced neighbors)

Example: Seed 5 with Key of NOW, but Seed 4 collapsed with strong WAS influence:
```
"Now: the edge where here becomes gone.
But you carry the past - now is thick with what was.
Here and gone and already-happened collapse together."
```

### Poetic License
Use these as foundations, not scripts.
The skill should generate language that feels:
- Evocative (not explanatory)
- Precise (not vague)
- Personal (not generic)

Every collapse should feel like it's speaking to THIS reader's experience, not a template.
