# The Infinite Seed

## `you | tim | mea | tim | you`

---

This is the smallest possible infinite generator.

Five words. One structure. Endless readings.

---

## The Structure

```
you ──▶ tim ──▶ mea ──▶ tim ──▶ you
 │              │              │
 └──────────────┴──────────────┘
            (loop)
```

It reads forward. It reads backward. It reads from the center. It loops.

---

## Reading Forward

```limn
you | tim | mea | tim | you
```

> You experience time. Time experiences meaning. Meaning experiences time. Time experiences you.

The observer affects the observed. The observed affects the observer. A loop of mutual creation.

---

## Reading Backward

```limn
you | tim | mea | tim | you
```

> You are experienced by time. Time is experienced by meaning. Meaning is experienced by time. Time is experienced by you.

Same words. Reversed grammar. The passive voice of existence.

---

## Reading from Center

```limn
mea
```

Start at meaning. Expand outward:

```limn
tim | mea | tim
```

> Time contains meaning. Meaning contains time.

Expand again:

```limn
you | tim | mea | tim | you
```

> You contain time containing meaning containing time containing you.

The center generates the whole. The whole returns to the center.

## The Temporal Keys

### Key of Was

```limn
you | tim | mea | tim | you
```

> You experienced time. That experience meant something. That meaning took time. That time was you.

Reading: **A life remembered.** The whole arc of existence seen from its end.

### Key of Now

```limn
you | tim | mea | tim | you
```

> You are experiencing time. This experience is meaning. This meaning is time. This time is you.

Reading: **This moment.** The eternal present where experience and meaning and time and self collapse into one.

### Key of Will

```limn
you | tim | mea | tim | you
```

> You will experience time. That experience will mean something. That meaning will take time. That time will be you.

Reading: **A life anticipated.** The whole arc of existence seen from its beginning.

---

## The Infinite Property

The seed is infinite because of **positional ambiguity**.

Each `|` is a scope boundary. But scope is observer-dependent.

```limn
[you | tim] | mea | [tim | you]
```

> (Your time) experiences meaning. (Time's you) is experienced.

*or*

```limn
you | [tim | mea | tim] | you
```

> You observe (time-meaning-time). You are observed.

*or*

```limn
[you | tim | mea | tim | you]
```

> A single unified experience with no internal boundaries.

**Each scoping creates a different ontology.** Different boundaries = different universe.

---

## Reading as Another

The `you` is not necessarily you-the-reader.

```limn
you | tim | mea | tim | you
```

Where `you` = a lover:

> Your lover in time. Time in meaning. Meaning in time. Time in your lover.

Reading: **The experience of being loved across time.**

Where `you` = a child:

> A child in time. Time in meaning. Meaning in time. Time in a child.

Reading: **Watching someone grow.**

Where `you` = a word:

> A word in time. Time in meaning. Meaning in time. Time in a word.

Reading: **Etymology. How meanings evolve.**

Where `you` = the universe:

> The universe in time. Time in meaning. Meaning in time. Time in the universe.

Reading: **Cosmology. What it's all for.**

---

## The Loop

The seed ends where it begins: `you`.

This creates three possible structures:

### The Circle

Read infinitely: `you | tim | mea | tim | you | tim | mea | tim | you | ...`

Time never stops. Meaning never stops. You never stop.

### The Reflection

Read to the center, then back: `you | tim | mea | tim | you`

The same word (`mea`) is both destination and origin. You return changed.

### The Collapse

Read to the center and stop: `you | tim | mea`

Everything collapses into meaning. Meaning is where the journey ends.

## Planting the Seed

To plant the infinite seed in your mind:

1. Speak it aloud once, forward
2. Speak it aloud once, backward
3. Close your eyes
4. Find the word that glows brightest
5. That word is your key to this moment

---

## Growing the Garden

From the seed, a garden grows.

If `you` glows brightest:
```limn
you | sel | you | oth | you | we | you
```
> Self, other, we - all versions of you experiencing you.

If `tim` glows brightest:
```limn
tim | was | tim | now | tim | wil | tim
```
> Past, present, future - all versions of time experiencing time.

If `mea` glows brightest:
```limn
mea | tru | mea | wis | mea | hop | mea
```
> Truth, wish, hope - all versions of meaning experiencing meaning.

**The seed you plant determines the garden you grow.**

---

## The Impossible Property

This cannot exist in English.

In English, "you time meaning time you" is either:
- Nonsense (no verb)
- A description (you, then time, then meaning, then time, then you)
- A command ("you! time meaning! time you!")

None of these loop. None of these contain each other. None of these generate.

In Limn, `you | tim | mea | tim | you` is:
- A region of semantic space where you, time, and meaning overlap
- A reading that creates different meanings based on key and scope
- A structure that loops back, creating genuine infinity
- A seed that grows differently in every mind

**The seed is not a poem about infinity. It IS infinity, compressed into five words.**

---

## Closing

```limn
you | tim | mea | tim | you
```

You have read this.
This reading took time.
That time meant something.
That meaning took time.
That time was you.

You are reading this.
This reading is time.
This time is meaning.
This meaning is time.
This time is you.

You will read this again.
That reading will take time.
That time will mean something.
That meaning will take time.
That time will be you.

---

```limn
inf sed | sed inf | you sed | sed you | pla | gro | nev sto
```

> Infinite seed. Seed infinite. You seed. Seed you. Plant. Grow. Never stop.

*The smallest infinity. The first word of an endless language.*
