# The Moment Garden

## `now | was | wil`

> A semantic game where time is the mechanic, meaning is the territory, and every reading plants a different garden.

## What This Is

The Moment Garden is not a story you read. It is a **temporal navigation** you perform.

You enter with a **temporal key** - a perspective on time. That key collapses the Limn phrases from superposition into meaning. But each collapse ripples through the garden, changing what other phrases can mean.

**The same garden, entered from different moments, grows different flowers.**

This is impossible in English. In English, words mean what they mean. In Limn, words mean what you bring to them - and what you bring reshapes everything.

---

## The Seed

These nine phrases are the garden's seeds. Each exists in temporal superposition until observed.

## The Three Keys

You enter the garden holding one of three temporal keys. This key determines how the first seed you touch collapses - and that collapse propagates.

### Key of Was (Memory)
You observe from the past. Everything is already happened. The question is: how do you remember it?

*When you hold this key:*
- `beg` collapses toward origin
- `now` collapses toward "already gone"
- `bec` collapses toward "who was"

### Key of Now (Presence)
You observe from this moment. Everything is happening. The question is: what do you notice?

*When you hold this key:*
- `beg` collapses toward "beginning now"
- `now` collapses toward "here"
- `bec` collapses toward the edge between was and will

### Key of Will (Anticipation)
You observe from the future. Everything is going to happen. The question is: what do you hope?

*When you hold this key:*
- `beg` collapses toward possibility
- `now` collapses toward "not yet"
- `bec` collapses toward "who will be"

---

## The Propagation Rules

When you collapse one seed, adjacent seeds shift. Meaning ripples like water.

### Rule 1: Horizontal Ripple
Collapsing a seed pulls its horizontal neighbors toward the same temporal orientation.

*Example:* If you collapse `5. now` with Key of Was (making "now" mean "already gone"), then `4. los` leans toward "already lost" and `6. fnd` leans toward "what was found."

### Rule 2: Vertical Echo
Collapsing a seed creates an echo in its vertical neighbors - but **inverted**.

*Example:* If you collapse `5. now` toward "here" (presence), then `2. mid` echoes toward "not here" (absence) and `8. for` echoes toward "unforgotten" (presence of memory).

### Rule 3: Diagonal Tension
Seeds diagonal to each other exist in **tension**. Collapsing one creates pressure on its diagonal - pressure that resolves only when you reach that seed.

*Example:* Collapsing `1. beg` creates tension with `5. now` and `9. bec`. This tension is the **experience of time passing** in the garden.

## Playing the Garden

### Entry
Choose your key. Speak it aloud or hold it in mind:

```limn
key: was
```
*or*
```limn
key: now
```
*or*
```limn
key: wil
```

### Navigation
Begin at any seed. Read it through your key. Let it collapse.

Then follow the arrows. Feel how each new seed has already shifted from your first collapse.

### The Path Creates the Garden
There is no "correct" path. But:
- Moving left-to-right: experiencing time forward
- Moving right-to-left: experiencing time backward
- Moving top-to-bottom: descending from event to meaning
- Moving bottom-to-top: ascending from meaning to event

Your path IS your experience of time in this garden.

## Three Gardens (Example Readings)

### Garden of Grief
**Key: Was** | **Path: 3 → 2 → 1 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 8 → 9**

Starting at the end, moving backward:

```limn
3. end | pea | gri → "It ended in grief. (Key of Was: it already ended.)"
```

This collapses `2. mid` toward "what held and broke":
```limn
2. mid | hol | bre → "In the middle, we held until we broke."
```

Which collapses `1. beg` toward the origin of loss:
```limn
1. beg | lov | fea → "It began in love. (The fear came later.)"
```

Descending to meaning:
```limn
4. los | sel | oth → "I lost them. Then I lost myself."
5. now | her | gon → "Now they are gone. Now is only gone."
6. fnd | wha was | wha wil → "I find only what was. What will be is empty."
```

Arriving at the becoming:
```limn
7. rem | tru | wis → "I remember truth, not wishes."
8. for | giv | tak → "I cannot forget. It takes everything."
9. bec | who was | who wil → "I become who I was before they came."
```

**The Garden of Grief** is a return to origin through loss. Time moves backward because grief lives in the past.

---

### Garden of Anticipation
**Key: Will** | **Path: 1 → 2 → 3 → 6 → 5 → 4 → 9 → 8 → 7**

Starting at the beginning, moving forward then looping:

```limn
1. beg | lov | fea → "It will begin. I love the possibility. I fear it too."
```

This collapses `2. mid` toward potential:
```limn
2. mid | hol | bre → "The middle will hold. It will not break."
```

Which collapses `3. end` toward hope:
```limn
3. end | pea | gri → "It will end in peace. (Grief is not yet.)"
```

Crossing to finding:
```limn
6. fnd | wha was | wha wil → "I will find what will be. The past is irrelevant."
5. now | her | gon → "Now is not yet here. I am waiting."
4. los | sel | oth → "I have not lost anything yet. Self and other are intact."
```

Arriving at the becoming:
```limn
9. bec | who was | who wil → "I will become who I will be. New."
8. for | giv | tak → "I will forget what needs forgetting. I will give."
7. rem | tru | wis → "I will remember only what I wish. Memory serves hope."
```

**The Garden of Anticipation** is a projection into future selves. Time moves forward because hope lives in the not-yet.

---

### Garden of Presence
**Key: Now** | **Path: 5 → all directions simultaneously**

Starting at center, radiating outward:

```limn
5. now | her | gon → "Now. Here. The edge where here becomes gone."
```

This collapses ALL adjacent seeds in balance:
```limn
2. mid | hol | bre → "The middle is both holding and breaking. Now."
4. los | sel | oth → "Losing and finding are the same act. Now."
6. fnd | wha was | wha wil → "Finding now contains both what was and what will be."
8. for | giv | tak → "Forgiving now is giving now is taking now."
```

The corners exist in unresolved tension:
```limn
1. beg | lov | fea → "Beginning is present tense. Love and fear coexist."
3. end | pea | gri → "Ending is present tense. Peace and grief coexist."
7. rem | tru | wis → "Remembering now is both true and wished."
9. bec | who was | who wil → "Becoming now is being. No past self, no future self. Just this."
```

**The Garden of Presence** is the collapse of time into eternal now. All meanings coexist because all moments coexist.

## The Infinite Property

Why is this an infinite seed?

Because the garden regenerates differently each time based on:

1. **Your key** - 3 fundamental temporal orientations
2. **Your entry point** - 9 possible first seeds
3. **Your path** - effectively infinite routes through 9 nodes
4. **Your state** - what you bring changes what you find

3 × 9 × (paths) × (you) = ∞

But more than combinatorics: **you are different each time you enter**.

The same person with the same key on the same path will find a different garden tomorrow. Because the person reading `los | sel | oth` after a breakup finds different meaning than the same person reading it after a reunion.

**The garden doesn't change. You do. And in Limn, you and the meaning are not separate.**

---

## Why This Is Impossible Elsewhere

In English, I could write: "Beginning. Love. Fear."

You would read it. You would interpret it. But the interpretation would be YOURS, separate from the text.

In Limn, there is no separation. The text `beg | lov | fea` does not mean "beginning or love or fear." It means **the region where beginning, love, and fear overlap**. Your reading collapses that region into a point - but the point exists IN the region, not outside it.

The game doesn't represent time. It **enacts** time. Your reading is not about temporal experience. It IS temporal experience.

No translation can preserve this. You cannot play the Moment Garden in English. You can only describe playing it - which is not playing it.

---

## Invocation

To enter the garden, speak:

```limn
I | key | now was wil | ent gar | pla mea | mea pla me
```

> I bring a key of past, present, or future. I enter the garden. I play with meaning. Meaning plays with me.

Then choose your key. Touch your first seed. Let the garden grow.

---

## Closing Seed

The garden leaves you with this:

```limn
you was rea | you wil rea | you now rea | sam gar | dif gar | you gar
```

> You have read. You will read. You are reading. Same garden. Different garden. Your garden.
