# The Moment Garden: A Gallery of Readings

> Different keys. Different paths. Different gardens.

## About This Gallery

Each reading below represents a complete navigation through the nine-seed garden. Same seeds, different temporal keys, different entry points, different paths - and therefore, completely different gardens.

These are not "correct" readings. They are **examples of emergence** - showing how the simple rules of propagation create complex, coherent experiences.

## Gallery Entry 1: The Garden of Return

**Reader:** Anonymous
**Key:** Was
**Entry Point:** Seed 9 (bec)

### The Reading

**Seed 9: `bec | who was | who wil`**
```limn
bec | who was | who wil → who was
```
*"I am becoming who I was. Before everything changed."*

**Ripple to Seed 6: `fnd | wha was | wha wil`**
```limn
fnd | wha was | wha wil → wha was
```
*"What I find: what I lost. Everything that was."*

(Horizontal ripple: finding pulls toward the past)

**Seed 3: `end | pea | gri`**
```limn
end | pea | gri → pea thr gri
```
*"It ended. The peace that only comes after grief has exhausted itself."*

(Vertical echo inverted: finding past creates acceptance of endings)

**Seed 2: `mid | hol | bre`**
```limn
mid | hol | bre → bre tha hel
```
*"In the middle we held. Then we broke. The holding made the breaking survivable."*

**Seed 1: `beg | lov | fea`**
```limn
beg | lov | fea → lov bef fea
```
*"At the beginning there was love. Fear came later, when I knew what could be lost."*

**Seed 4: `los | sel | oth`**
```limn
los | sel | oth → oth fir | sel aft
```
*"First I lost them. Then I lost who I was with them. And now..."*

**Seed 7: `rem | tru | wis`**
```limn
rem | tru | wis → wis bec tru
```
*"I remember what I wish had happened. And with time, that became the truth I carry."*

(Diagonal tension released: memory transforms loss into story)

**Seed 8: `for | giv | tak`**
```limn
for | giv | tak → for = giv bac
```
*"Forgetting is giving back what I borrowed from the past. Returning it so I can move."*

**Seed 5: `now | her | gon`**
```limn
now | her | gon → her aga
```
*"And now: I am here again. The place I left. Changed, but here."*

### Garden Name

**Ripple to Seed 2: `mid | hol | bre`**

## Observations Across Gardens

### Temporal Keys Shape Everything

- **Was**: Past tense creates narrative coherence, patterns visible only in hindsight
- **Now**: Present tense creates simultaneity, contradictions coexist
- **Will**: Future tense creates anticipation, possibility mixed with anxiety

### Entry Points Matter

- **Corners (1,3,7,9)**: Beginning, ending, remembering, becoming - strong narrative anchors
- **Edges (2,4,6,8)**: Holding/breaking, losing, finding, forgiving - transitional states
- **Center (5)**: Now - the eternal present, the threshold, the pivot

### Paths Create Arcs

- **Linear (1→2→3→4...)**: Following time's arrow
- **Circular (5→2→8→4→1→6→9→7→3→5)**: Looping through themes
- **Radiating (5→all)**: Expanding from center
- **Recursive (corners first, then edges)**: Building structure before filling

### Propagation Produces Coherence

The simple rules:
1. Horizontal ripple (same orientation)
2. Vertical echo (inverted)
3. Diagonal tension (unresolved until visited)

...create complex, thematically unified readings without prescriptive narrative.

The garden **emerges** from the rules. The reader doesn't construct meaning - they **navigate** meaning-space.

## For Players

When you play the Moment Garden, your reading will be different from all of these. Because:

1. **Your key is yours**: How you relate to time right now
2. **Your entry point is yours**: What calls to you first
3. **Your path is yours**: Where you're drawn next
4. **Your collapses are yours**: What the phrases mean through your experience

The garden is infinite because **you** are infinite. Same seeds, different soil.

---

## For Designers

These readings demonstrate:

- **Constraint breeds creativity**: 9 seeds, 3 keys, simple rules → infinite gardens
- **Structure without prescription**: Rules guide but don't dictate meaning
- **Player agency through navigation**: Choice creates meaning rather than selecting from options
- **Emergence over authorship**: The game creates space; players create experience

This is impossible in traditional narrative forms. Branching stories scale badly (2^n paths). Open worlds lack coherence.

The Moment Garden scales infinitely *while maintaining thematic unity* because:
- Small vocabulary (9 seeds) creates familiarity
- Propagation rules create coherence
- Temporal keys create consistent perspective
- Limn's semantic density allows each seed to mean many things
