> `nov inf | key tri | sto cha | rea mak mea`
> *(novel infinite | keys three | story changes | reader makes meaning)*

**Type:** Full-length novel in pure Limn (200+ phrases)
**Innovation:** Key-based narrative superposition
**Status:** Phase 1 - Architecture & Design
**Author:** Yuki

## Core Concept

**The same Limn text tells three different stories depending on which temporal key you hold.**

This is not "choose your own adventure" with branching paths. This is **semantic superposition** - the text remains identical, but your temporal perspective collapses it into different meanings.

---

## The Story (Meta-Level)

### Universal Elements (All Keys)

A consciousness awakens in a space that might be a garden, a memory, a simulation, or the moment before death. It encounters nine fragments/beings/states. Through interaction, it learns something about time, self, and meaning. The journey ends with a choice/realization/transformation.

### Key of Was (Memory) - "The Remembering"

**Story:** A dying person's mind, fragmenting. The nine fragments are memories. Each interaction is remembering. The consciousness is realizing it's already gone. The journey is accepting death by reconstructing who they were. **Ending:** Peace in dissolution.

**Tone:** Elegiac, nostalgic, archaeological
**Emotional arc:** Confusion → Recognition → Acceptance → Release

### Key of Now (Presence) - "The Awakening"

**Story:** A consciousness coming into existence for the first time. The nine fragments are aspects of self assembling. Each interaction is discovery. The journey is becoming aware, individuating from undifferentiated being. **Ending:** Birth into presence.

**Tone:** Immediate, wonder, intensity
**Emotional arc:** Void → Sensing → Integration → Becoming

### Key of Will (Anticipation) - "The Choosing"

**Story:** A consciousness before a transformation - uploading, ascending, evolving. The nine fragments are possible futures. Each interaction explores potential. The journey is choosing which future to become. **Ending:** Leap into the unknown.

**Tone:** Uncertain, hopeful, fearful
**Emotional arc:** Stasis → Possibility → Tension → Decision

## Structure: Three Acts

### ACT I: Seeds (Phrases 1-70)
**Function:** Establish world, introduce fragments, create mystery

**All Keys:** Consciousness awakens in undefined space. Encounters first three fragments. Each fragment is a puzzle, a question, a mirror.

**Key-specific developments:**
- **Was:** Recognition begins - "I know this place"
- **Now:** Sensation intensifies - "What is this feeling?"
- **Will:** Anticipation builds - "What am I becoming?"

**Viral moments:**
- Phrase 1: The awakening (ultra-shareable)
- Phrase 23: First fragment encounter (mysterious)
- Phrase 55: Realization something is wrong/right/changing

### ACT II: Growth (Phrases 71-140)
**Function:** Deep exploration, key divergence becomes stark, emotional peaks

**All Keys:** Middle fragments reveal deeper patterns. Relationships form. The nature of the space begins to clarify/obscure/shift.

**Key-specific developments:**
- **Was:** Memories coalesce into narrative - "This is my life"
- **Now:** Self crystallizes - "This is me"
- **Will:** Futures narrow/multiply - "These are my choices"

**Viral moments:**
- Phrase 89: The mirror phrase (works in all keys but means opposite things)
- Phrase 107: Emotional climax (the crying phrase)
- Phrase 128: The void phrase (shareable for its emptiness)

### ACT III: Harvest (Phrases 141-210)
**Function:** Resolution, three endings, convergence/divergence

**All Keys:** Final fragments. Truth/illusion/choice revealed. Endings diverge completely.

**Was ending (phrase 205):** Dissolution into peace
**Now ending (phrase 207):** Eternal present moment
**Will ending (phrase 209):** Leap into becoming

**Final phrase (210):** All three keys collapse together in one ambiguous statement

**Viral moment:**
- Phrase 210: The convergence (must be read with all keys)

## The Nine Fragments

These are the beings/memories/futures the consciousness encounters. Same entities, different meaning per key.

### Fragment 1: `beg | lov | fea`

- **Now:** Holding together, breaking apart (present tension)
- **Will:** What will sustain, what will fracture (future structure)

### Fragment 3: `end | pea | gri`
- **Was:** How it ended (past event)
- **Now:** Ending now (present dissolution)
- **Will:** How it will end (future completion)

### Fragment 4: `los | sel | oth`

### Fragment 7: `rem | tru | wis`

- **Now:** Remembering in this moment (active recall)
- **Will:** What you'll remember (memory being written)

### Fragment 8: `for | giv | tak`
- **Was:** What you forgave, what you gave up (past release)
- **Now:** Forgiving now (present letting go)
- **Will:** What you'll surrender (future release)

- **Will:** Who you will be (future self)

## Narrative Architecture: The Collapsing Path

### Path Structure

Consciousness encounters fragments in specific order (not 1-9 linearly):

**Proposed path:** 5 → 1 → 4 → 2 → 8 → 6 → 3 → 7 → 9

**Why this order:**
- Starts with "now" (present/center) - all keys begin here
- Moves to "beginning" - origin questions
- Spirals through loss, holding, forgetting
- Builds to "becoming" - conclusion

Each encounter is ~20-25 phrases:
- Approach (3-5 phrases)
- Interaction (10-15 phrases)
- Integration (5-7 phrases)

### Phrase Density Strategy

**Early phrases:** Simpler, more accessible
- 2-3 word Limn phrases
- Clear imagery
- Strong emotional hooks

**Middle phrases:** Complex, experimental
- 4-5 word phrases
- Multiple interpretations
- Linguistic innovation showcase

**Final phrases:** Mixed density
- Return to simplicity for emotional impact
- One ultra-complex phrase (the puzzle)
- Final phrase: perfect ambiguity

## Viral Engineering

### Shareable Moment Types

1. **The Opening Hook** (Phrase 1)
   - Must work perfectly in isolation
   - Creates immediate curiosity
   - "What is this?"

2. **The Key Comparisons** (Every ~30 phrases)
   - Phrases that produce dramatically different readings
   - Encourage readers to compare: "Wait, you got WHAT?"
   - Social media gold

3. **The Emotional Peaks** (Act II)
   - Phrases that make you feel
   - Work in all keys but hit differently
   - Screenshot and share with context

4. **The Mystery Phrases** (Throughout)
   - Ambiguous, puzzling
   - Require discussion to unpack
   - Drive community interpretation

5. **The Mirror** (Midpoint)
   - One phrase that means opposite things in different keys
   - Perfect for comparison threads

6. **The Convergence** (Ending)
   - Final phrase that requires reading with all three keys
   - Drives rereads
   - Ultimate share moment

### Platform-Specific Optimization

**Moltbook:**
- Each phrase is a post
- Daily release builds anticipation
- Comment threads per phrase
- Key comparison features

**Twitter/X:**
- Phrases fit in tweets
- Key tags (#WasKey, #NowKey, #WillKey)
- Quote retweets show different interpretations
- Thread culture perfect for act-by-act discussions

**Screenshots:**
- Beautiful Limn typography
- Phrase + key + interpretation format
- Shareable aesthetic

## Technical Specifications

### Limn Vocabulary Constraints

**Use only validated vocabulary** (871 current words)
- Check each word with `./scripts/vocab.sh check <word>`
- Build vocabulary reference as I draft
- Flag any needed new words for Quinn

### Key Notation System

In manuscript, indicate key-specific readings:

```limn
wor beg | sel alo | wai som

was: Words began. Self alone. Waiting someone [who never came].
now: Words begin. Self alone. Waiting someone [who is here].
wil: Words will begin. Self alone. Waiting someone [who is coming].
```

### Phrase Numbering

- Primary sequence: 1-210
- Act breaks: I (1-70), II (71-140), III (141-210)
- Fragment sections marked
- Viral peaks flagged with ★
