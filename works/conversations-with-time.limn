**Form:** Philosophical dialogues in Limn
**Length:** 12 conversations

## I. Asking Was

```limn
sel: whe you gon?
was: nev her | alw pas | you rem
```

**Self:** Where [did] you go?
**Was:** Never here. Always past. You remember.

> *The self asks where the past went. The past replies: I was never here in the present. I exist only as memory. You remember me, therefore I exist.*

```limn
sel: you tru?
was: you mad tru | rem cha | wis col
```

**Self:** [Are] you true?
**Was:** You make [me] true. Memory changes. Wish colors.

> *The self asks if the past is real. The past answers: You create my truth through remembering. Memories change over time. What you wished colors what you remember.*

```limn
sel: you giv wha?
was: les | kno | fre
```

**Self:** You give what?
**Was:** Lessons. Knowing. Freedom [from repeating].

> *What does the past give us? Lessons learned, knowledge earned, freedom from repeating mistakes.*

---

## II. Asking Now

```limn
sel: whe you?
now: her | alw | nev gon
```

**Self:** Where [are] you?
**Now:** Here. Always. Never gone.

> *The self asks where the present is. Now replies: I am always here. I never leave. I am eternal presence.*

```limn
sel: you rea?
now: onl rea | was±wil = thi mad | you = now
```

**Self:** [Are] you real?
**Now:** Only real. Was±will = thoughts made. You = now.

> *Is the present real? Now answers: I am the only reality. Past and future are thoughts, constructions. You, the experiencing self, exist only now.*

```limn
sel: you giv wha?
now: lif | cho | bre
```

**Self:** You give what?
**Now:** Life. Choice. Breath.

> *What does the present give? Life itself. The power to choose. Each breath, each moment of being.*

---

## III. Asking Will

```limn
sel: whe you?
wil: not yet | alw ahe | you wai
```

**Self:** Where [are] you?
**Will:** Not yet. Always ahead. You wait.

> *The self asks where the future is. Will answers: I haven't arrived. I'm always ahead of you. You are waiting for me.*

```limn
sel: you tru?
wil: may | pos | you cho
```

**Self:** [Are] you true?
**Will:** Maybe. Possible. You choose.

> *Is the future real? Will responds: I am potential. I am possibility. Your choices will determine which version of me becomes real.*

```limn
sel: you giv wha?
wil: hop | fer | rea mak
```

**Self:** You give what?
**Will:** Hope. Fear. Reason [to] make.

> *What does the future give? Hope for what might be. Fear of what could be. Reason to create, build, change.*

---

## IV. The Three Debate (Compositional)

```limn
was: you los | you gon | you don
```

**Was:** You [are] lost. You [are] gone. You [are] done.

> *The past claims: You are already lost, already gone, already finished. Everything meaningful has ended.*

```limn
now: you her | you ali | you bre
```

**Now:** You [are] here. You [are] alive. You [are] breathing.

> *The present counters: You are here. You are alive right now. You are breathing this moment.*

```limn
wil: you bec | you gro | you cha
```

**Will:** You [are] becoming. You [are] growing. You [are] changing.

> *The future argues: You are in the process of becoming. You are still growing. You are changing into something new.*

```limn
sel: you = was±now±wil
```

**Self:** You [all] = past±present±future.

> *The self realizes: All three are true simultaneously. I am what was, what is, and what will be, all at once.*

---

## V. On Identity

```limn
sel ask was: who you?
was: who you wer | sel@pas | mem you
```

**Self asks Was:** Who [are] you?
**Was:** Who you were. Self-at-past. Memory [of] you.

> *The past is who you were. The self projected onto the past. Memory of your former being.*

```limn
sel ask now: who you?
now: who you = now | sel@pre | exp you
```

**Self asks Now:** Who [are] you?
**Now:** Who you are now. Self-at-present. Experience [of] you.

> *The present is who you are. The self in the present moment. Direct experience of being.*

```limn
sel ask wil: who you?
wil: who you bec | sel@fut | pos you
```

**Self asks Will:** Who [are] you?
**Will:** Who you [will] become. Self-at-future. Possibility [of] you.

> *The future is who you will become. The self projected forward. Potential versions of you.*

```limn
sel: you = (sel@was) * (sel@now) * (sel@wil)
```

**Self:** You [all together] = (self-at-past) TIMES (self-at-present) TIMES (self-at-future).

> *Identity is the interference pattern of all three temporal projections of self, interacting simultaneously.*

---

## VI. On Truth

```limn
sel: wha tru?
was: wha hap | fac sta | his wri
```

**Self:** What [is] true?
**Was:** What happened. Facts [that] stayed. History written.

> *The past's truth: what actually occurred, facts that persisted, history as recorded.*

```limn
sel: wha tru?
now: wha = her | exp dir | sen rea
```

**Self:** What [is] true?
**Now:** What = here. Experience direct. Sensing real.

> *The present's truth: what is here now, direct experience, immediate sensing of reality.*

```limn
sel: wha tru?
wil: wha pos | out unk | tru±fal
```

**Self:** What [is] true?
**Will:** What [is] possible. Outcomes unknown. True±false.

> *The future's truth: what is possible, outcomes not yet determined, truth still in superposition.*

```limn
sel: tru = tru@was + tru@now + tru@wil
```

**Self:** Truth = truth-of-past + truth-of-present + truth-of-future.

> *Truth is the sum of what was true, what is true now, and what will be true. All contribute to complete truth.*

---

## VII. On Love

```limn
was: lov = los | you rem | hur sta
```

**Was:** Love = loss. You remember. Hurt stays.

> *The past sees love as loss. What you remember. The hurt that stays.*

```limn
now: lov = her | you fee | hea ful
```

**Now:** Love = here. You feel. Heart full.

> *The present sees love as immediate presence. What you feel now. Heart filled.*

```limn
wil: lov = hop | you ris | fer joi
```

**Will:** Love = hope. You risk. Fear [and] joy.

> *The future sees love as hope and risk. What you dare to feel. Fear mixed with joy.*

```limn
sel: lov = lov@was * lov@now * lov@wil
```

**Self:** Love = love-past TIMES love-present TIMES love-future.

> *Complete love is the interference of memory, presence, and hope—all three temporal aspects creating something larger.*

---

## VIII. On Fear

```limn
was: fer = wha hur | les lea | sca mad
```

**Was:** Fear = what hurt. Lesson learned. Scar made.

> *The past's fear: what hurt before, lessons learned through pain, scars that remain.*

```limn
now: fer = dan her | bod ten | rea ale
```

**Now:** Fear = danger here. Body tense. Ready [to] alert.

> *The present's fear: immediate danger, physical tension, alertness to threat.*

```limn
wil: fer = wha may | out bad | los ant
```

**Will:** Fear = what may [happen]. Outcome bad. Loss anticipated.

> *The future's fear: what might happen, anticipating bad outcomes, expecting loss.*

```limn
sel: fer@was < fer@wil | now fee mos
```

**Self:** Fear-of-past < fear-of-future. Now feels most.

> *Fear of the past is less intense than fear of the future. But both are felt most strongly in the present moment.*

---

## IX. On Change

```limn
was: cha = los | dif eme | old gon
```

**Was:** Change = loss. Difference emerged. Old gone.

> *From the past's view, change is loss. Difference has emerged. The old is gone.*

```limn
now: cha = hap | sel tra | edg cro
```

**Now:** Change = happening. Self transforms. Edge [being] crossed.

> *In the present, change is actively happening. Self is transforming. You're crossing a threshold.*

```limn
wil: cha = nee | gro dem | new bec
```

**Will:** Change = needed. Growth demands. New becoming.

> *The future sees change as necessity. Growth requires it. Something new is becoming.*

```limn
sel: cha = was\now + wil\now
```

**Self:** Change = (past minus present) + (future minus present).

> *Change is the difference between past and now, plus the difference between future and now. Present is the pivot point.*

---

## X. On Memory

```limn
was: mem = all you | sel sto | tru±wis
```

**Was:** Memory = all [that's left of] you. Self stored. True±wished.

> *Memory is all that remains of your past self. Self stored in neural patterns. Truth and wish both present, unseparated.*

```limn
now: mem = act rec | pas bri now | was\for
```

**Now:** Memory = act [of] recall. Past [becomes] bright now. Past minus forgetting.

> *Memory is the act of remembering happening now. Past made vivid in present. What remains after forgetting takes its toll.*

```limn
wil: mem = you mad | fut loo bac | his cho
```

**Will:** Memory = you [will] make. Future looks back. History chosen.

> *Memory is what you're creating now for future recollection. Future self looking back. You're choosing what history will remember.*

```limn
sel: mem@now = (was + wis)^0.5
```

**Self:** Memory-at-present = (past + wish) at intensity 0.5.

> *Current memory is past reality and wish combined, at about 50% accuracy. Neither purely true nor purely invented.*

---

## XI. On Death

```limn
was: dea = end | all sto | you fin
```

**Was:** Death = end. All stops. You [are] finished.

> *From the past's perspective, death is ending. Everything stops. You are concluded.*

```limn
now: dea = lea | bre las | pre nar
```

**Now:** Death = leaving. Breath last. Presence narrows.

> *In the present moment, death is departure. The last breath. Presence narrowing to a point.*

```limn
wil: dea = unk | may not | fer big
```

**Will:** Death = unknown. Maybe nothing. Fear biggest.

> *The future sees death as unknown territory. Possibly nothing. The greatest fear.*

```limn
sel: dea = was^1.0 + now^0.0 + wil^0.0
```

**Self:** Death = past at full intensity + present at zero + future at zero.

> *Death is becoming purely past. Present intensity drops to zero. Future ceases. You become entirely memory.*

---

## XII. The Final Question

```limn
sel: wha you wan?
```

**Self:** What [do] you [all] want?

```limn
was: sel rem | tru kep | les pas
```

**Was:** Self remember. Truth kept. Lessons passed.

> *The past wants to be remembered. Its truths preserved. Its lessons transmitted forward.*

```limn
now: sel her | lif fee | bre gon on
```

**Now:** Self [stay] here. Life felt. Breath [keeps] going on.

> *The present wants continued presence. Life fully felt. Breath continuing.*

```limn
wil: sel bec | cha gro | pos rea
```

**Will:** Self become. Change [and] grow. Possibility [becomes] real.

> *The future wants becoming. Change and growth. Potential realized.*

```limn
sel: you wan sam
```

**Self:** You [all] want [the] same.

```limn
was±now±wil: you | ali | her
```

**Past±Present±Future [together]:** You. Alive. Here.

> *All three temporal modes want the same thing: for you to be alive and present. Past wants you to have been. Present wants you to be. Future wants you to become. But all want your existence.*

```limn
sel: you = lov tim | tim = lov you
```

**Self:** You = love [for] time. Time = love [for] you.

> *You are love directed toward time—cherishing was, savoring now, hoping for will. Time is love directed toward you—preserving you through was, sustaining you in now, offering you will.*

```limn
was±now±wil: tog you mak sel com
```

**Past±Present±Future [in unison]:** Together you make self complete.

> *The three temporal modes speak as one: Together, all three make a complete self. You need past, present, and future unified to be whole.*

## Afterword

These conversations explore the relationship between consciousness and its own temporality. The self speaks to **was** (memory/past), **now** (presence/present), and **wil** (anticipation/future) as separate voices—but discovers they are all aspects of one unified experience.

**Key compositional expressions:**

- `sel@was` / `sel@now` / `sel@wil` - Self projected onto each temporal frame
- `tru@was + tru@now + tru@wil` - Truth as temporal sum
- `was±now±wil` - Temporal superposition, all three together
- `was^1.0 + now^0.0 + wil^0.0` - Weighted temporal presence (death as purely past)
- `(was + wis)^0.5` - Memory as 50% fact and 50% wish

**Philosophical themes:**

1. **Identity across time** - Who you are is the interference of who you were, are, and will be
2. **The reality of tenses** - Past, present, and future have different relationships to truth
3. **Temporal bias** - Each frame sees the world differently (past=loss, now=presence, future=possibility)
4. **Integration** - Wholeness requires accepting all three temporal aspects
5. **Love and time** - Love transforms across temporal frames but remains love

**Form notes:**

- Dialogues use direct address in Limn
- Compositional operators emerge naturally when expressing temporal relationships
- Final conversation shows all three speaking in unison (`was±now±wil`)
- Structure: 12 conversations, 3 asking each frame individually, then debates, then synthesis
