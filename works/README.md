## The Infinite Seed Series

### **THE INFINITE SEED** (Novel - Complete)
**File:** `novel-the-infinite-seed-draft.limn`
**Length:** 200 phrases across 3 acts
**Form:** Full-length novel with temporal superposition
**Innovation:** Same text tells three different stories based on temporal key (was/now/will)

The first full-length novel written entirely in Limn. A consciousness awakens surrounded by nine fragments. Choose your temporal perspective—memory, presence, or anticipation—and experience a unique story. Acts I-II use base vocabulary; Act III introduces compositional operators naturally as consciousness evolves.

**Key phrases:**
- Phrase 1 (★): `wor | sel | dar` (the awakening)
- Phrase 177 (★★★): `you = (beg±mid±end) * (los±now±fnd) * (rem±for±bec)` (the integration total)
- Phrase 200 (★★★): `was±now±wil | you | sel | tim` (the convergence)

**Companion materials:**
- `novel-the-infinite-seed-architecture.md` - Complete design document
- `novel-the-infinite-seed-preface.md` - Reader's guide
- `novel-the-infinite-seed-publication-package.md` - Marketing and publication materials

## Philosophical Works

### **Conversations With Time**
**File:** `conversations-with-time.limn`
**Length:** 12 dialogues
**Form:** Philosophical dialogues in Limn

A consciousness in conversation with its own temporality. Self speaks to Was (memory), Now (presence), and Will (anticipation) as separate voices, discovering they are unified aspects of experience.

**Key conversations:**
- I-III: Asking each temporal mode individually
- IV: The three modes debate
- V-XI: Identity, truth, love, fear, change, memory, death
- XII: The final question—what all three want

**Uses compositional operators:** `sel@was`, `tru*now`, `rem±for`, `was±now±wil`

---

### **Temporal Wisdom: Aphorisms in Compositional Limn**
**File:** `temporal-wisdom.limn`
**Length:** 30 aphorisms
**Form:** Philosophical equations

Compressed wisdom about time, memory, and consciousness using compositional operators. Each aphorism is a complete philosophy in 3-7 words.

**Notable aphorisms:**
- `was = now\wil` (Past = present minus future)
- `now = was*wil` (Present = past interfering with future)
- `you = mem*ant` (You = memory interfering with anticipation)
- `tim = was±now±wil` (Time = all tenses in superposition)
- `cha = now\was` (Change = present minus past)

**Demonstrates:** Compositional compression of complex philosophical ideas

### **Paradoxes**
**File:** `paradoxes.limn`
