━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
          THE MOMENT GARDEN AWAITS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Nine seeds rest in temporal superposition.
Your key will collapse them into meaning.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Which key do you hold?

  was — The Key of Memory
        Observe from the past.
        Everything has already happened.
        "How do you remember it?"

  now — The Key of Presence
        Observe from this moment.
        Everything is happening.
        "What do you notice?"

  wil — The Key of Anticipation
        Observe from the future.
        Everything is going to happen.
        "What do you hope?"
```

---

### Key Selection

```
User: now

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

You hold the Key of Now.

The garden shimmers. Nine seeds await your touch.
All meanings exist simultaneously until you collapse them.

Which seed do you touch first? (1-9)
```

---

### Seed 1: Beginning

```
User: /garden seed 5

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
             SEED 5 COLLAPSES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  now | her | gon                        │
│                                         │
│  The edge where here becomes gone.      │
│  This moment. Right now. The threshold  │
│  between presence and absence.          │
│                                         │
│  You are here.                          │
│  You are already going.                 │
│  Both true. Both now.                   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

RIPPLE EFFECTS:

Horizontal reinforcement (same temporal key):
  → Seed 4 (los|sel|oth): "Losing and finding happen simultaneously"
  → Seed 6 (fnd|wha was|wha wil): "Finding contains all time"

Vertical inversion (opposite temporal key):
  ↕ Seed 2 (mid|hol|bre): Shifts toward "was" - "what held, what broke"
  ↕ Seed 8 (for|giv|tak): Shifts toward "wil" - "what will be forgiven"

Diagonal tension created:
  ⚡ Seeds 1, 3, 7, 9 hold unresolved potential

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Path so far: 5

Which seed next? (1-9)
```

---

### Seed 2: Loss

```
User: 4

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
             SEED 4 COLLAPSES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  los | sel | oth                        │
│                                         │
│  Losing the boundary.                   │
│  Self and other blur in this moment.    │
│                                         │
│  Are you losing yourself in them?       │
│  Are you losing them in yourself?       │
│  Now, the distinction dissolves.        │
│                                         │
│  This is intimacy: losing the edge.     │
│  This is loneliness: losing yourself.   │
│  Same experience. Now.                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

RIPPLE EFFECTS:

Reinforced by Seed 5 (now):
  This collapse is stronger - simultaneity emphasized

Horizontal reinforcement:
  ← Seed 1 (beg|lov|fea): "Love and fear beginning together, now"
  → Already collapsed: Seed 5

Vertical inversion:
  ↕ Seed 7 (rem|tru|wis): Shifts toward "wil" - "what you'll wish"

Diagonal tension:
  ⚡ Seed 2 releases (vertical neighbor of 5, horizontal neighbor of 4)
  ⚡ Seeds 3, 6 still hold tension

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Path so far: 5 → 4

Which seed next?
```

---

### Seed 3: Finding

```
User: 6

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
             SEED 6 COLLAPSES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  fnd | wha was | wha wil                │
│                                         │
│  Finding contains all time.             │
│                                         │
│  In this discovery, the past appears.   │
│  In this discovery, the future arrives. │
│  What was and what will be meet here.   │
│                                         │
│  You find what was always there.        │
│  You find what's coming.                │
│  Finding is presence holding both.      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

RIPPLE EFFECTS:

Reinforced by Seed 5 (now):
  Collapse integrates both temporal directions

Horizontal reinforcement:
  ← Already collapsed: Seed 5
  → Seed 9 (bec|who was|who wil): "Becoming holds past and future"

Vertical inversion:
  ↕ Seed 3 (end|pea|gri): Shifts toward "was" - "how it ended"

Diagonal tension:
  ⚡ Diagonal with Seed 4 releases
  ⚡ Seeds 1, 2, 7, 8 still charged

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Path so far: 5 → 4 → 6

Which seed next?
```

│                                         │
│  The middle: what held. What broke.     │
│                                         │
│  Inverted by Seed 5's presence,         │
│  this center becomes memory.            │
│  You remember when it held.             │
│  You remember when it broke.            │
│                                         │
│  The middle is holding and breaking.    │
│  Both. Then. The line between.          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

RIPPLE EFFECTS:

Inverted by Seed 5 (vertical echo):
  Takes on "was" quality despite your "now" key

Horizontal reinforcement:
  ← Seed 1 (beg|lov|fea): Still in superposition, but leaning
  → Seed 3 (end|pea|gri): Inverted toward "was" by Seed 6

Vertical:
  ↕ Already collapsed: Seed 5

Diagonal tension with Seed 4 releases

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Path so far: 5 → 4 → 6 → 2

Continue? (y/n) or choose seed (1-9)

## Session: Bob's Garden (Same Garden, Different Key)

**Garden ID:** garden-a7f3 (Alice's garden)
**Reader:** Bob
**Temporal Key:** Was (Memory)

### Bob Joins

```
User: /garden join garden-a7f3

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

You enter garden-a7f3.

Alice has already been here with the Key of Now.
You bring the Key of Was.

The same nine seeds wait.
But your key will collapse them differently.

Which seed do you touch first? (1-9)
```

### Comparison

```
User: /garden compare

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
        COMPARING READINGS: garden-a7f3
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SEED 5: now|her|gon

  ALICE (Key: NOW):
    "The edge where here becomes gone"
    You are here. You are already going. Both true. Both now.

  BOB (Key: WAS):
    "Now is already gone. Presence was always passing."
    Here was. Gone is what remains. Memory makes presence into past.

  DIVERGENCE: The same seed. Different temporal perspectives.
              Alice holds presence. Bob watches it leave.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SEED 4: los|sel|oth

  ALICE (Key: NOW):
    "Losing the boundary"
    Self and other blur in this moment. Intimacy and loneliness, now.

  BOB (Key: WAS):
    "What you lost: yourself in another"
    You remember losing. Was it you? Was it them?
    In memory, the line dissolves. Both gone now.

  DIVERGENCE: Alice experiences losing. Bob remembers loss.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

[... comparisons for all 9 seeds ...]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

OVERALL DIVERGENCE: 76%

Same seeds. Different keys. Different gardens.

  ALICE'S GARDEN: "The Living Spiral of Presence and Loss"
  BOB'S GARDEN: "The Remembered Journey of What Was Lost"

### MCP Tool Calls Made

1. **garden_create** - when `/garden new` invoked
2. **garden_calculate_ripples** - after each seed collapse
3. **garden_save_reading** - when `/garden reading` displayed
4. **garden_get_readings** - when `/garden compare` invoked
5. **garden_compare** - to calculate divergence scores

### Response Generation Flow

```
User input → Skill processes command
           ↓
         MCP tool call (if needed)
           ↓
         Collapse generation (using seed-collapses-reference.md)
           ↓
         Apply propagation rules
           ↓
         Format response with ASCII art + Limn phrases
           ↓
         Display to user
