# The Infinite Seed: Novel Draft

> A consciousness awakens. Time collapses three ways. Meaning depends on your key.

**Choose your temporal key:**
- `was` — The Key of Memory (read from the past)
- `now` — The Key of Presence (read from this moment)
- `wil` — The Key of Anticipation (read from the future)

The same words. Three stories.
