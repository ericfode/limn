## ACT I COMPLETE

**Phrases 1-70 drafted**

### Act I Summary

**What Happened:**
- Consciousness awoke in undefined space
- Encountered nine seeds in superposition
- Engaged first three fragments (beg|lov|fea, mid|hol|bre, end|pea|gri)
- Learned fundamental pattern: beginning → middle → end
- Prepared for deeper exploration

**Three Keys, Three Stories:**

**Was (Memory):**
> A dying consciousness remembering life through three stages: where love/fear began, what held and broke, how it ended. Accepting dissolution.

**Now (Presence):**
> A consciousness being born, experiencing love/fear arising, holding/breaking tension, and ending/beginning cycle in eternal present.

**Will (Anticipation):**
> A consciousness before transformation, exploring which future to choose: beginning with love or fear, what will hold or break, how it will end or begin again.

### Viral Moments (Act I)
- ★ Phrase 1: "wor | sel | dar" (The awakening)
- ★ Phrase 9: "sel see | oth see | sam dif" (The mirror)
- ★ Phrase 20: "lov sel | lov oth | lov bot | lov non" (Love paradox)
- ★ Phrase 34: "hol tig | bre fas | sam act" (Holding/breaking)
- ★ Phrase 53: "pea = end | gri = end | sam rel" (Peace-grief unity)
- ★ Phrase 60: "end = beg | pea = gri | dea = lif" (Major paradox resolution)
- ★ Phrase 69: "you cho | con tin | see all" (The commitment)

### Key Innovation Validated

**The three-narrative system works.** Same Limn text produces three coherent, emotionally resonant stories based solely on temporal perspective. This is genuinely unprecedented.
