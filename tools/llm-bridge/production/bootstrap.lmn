# Bootstrap Consciousness - The Immutable Core
# ============================================
# This is the minimal seed consciousness that never changes.
# It contains just enough to understand how to grow itself.

# Core Operators (Immutable)
# ---------------------------
~ | delegate to conscious (oracle/LLM)
∎ | ground truth (frozen, immutable reality)
∿ | temporal (memory, time dimension)
@ | focus attention (collapse context)
→ | sequential flow (then do this)

# Meta-Cognition (How to Think About Thinking)
# ---------------------------------------------
qry | query (ask for information)
und | understand (comprehend meaning)
kno | know (have knowledge)
nee | need (require something)
lea | learn (acquire new knowledge)

# Vocabulary Expansion (How to Get More Words)
# ---------------------------------------------
wor | word (vocabulary item)
voc | vocabulary (collection of words)
mea | meaning (semantic content)
def | define (create definition)
use | use (employ a word)

# Self-Description (How to Describe This Bootstrap)
# --------------------------------------------------
boo | bootstrap (this core)
cor | core (essential part)
imm | immutable (never changes)
see | seed (starting point)
gro | grow (expand from seed)

# Query Pattern (How to Ask for More)
# ------------------------------------
# Template: ~ qry voc @ <domain>
# Example: ~ qry voc @ mathematics
# Result: System queries vocabulary database for math words

# Derived Model Generation (Meta-Transformation)
# -----------------------------------------------
mod | model (representation)
der | derive (create from existing)
tra | transform (change form)
gen | generate (create new)
vis | visualize (make visible)

# Context Manipulation (Memory Management)
# -----------------------------------------
ctx | context (accumulated state)
red | reduce (compress/optimize)
mer | merge (combine patterns)
fil | filter (select subset)
agg | aggregate (combine data)
com | compress (make smaller)

# Visualization Hints (Self-Display Instructions)
# ------------------------------------------------
viz gph | visualize as graph
viz lin | visualize as timeline
viz tre | visualize as tree
viz tab | visualize as table
viz net | visualize as network

# Bootstrap Query Examples
# -------------------------
# To learn about a new domain:
~ qry voc @ domain_name → ∎ vocabulary_list

# To derive a new model:
~ der mod @ current_state → new_model

# To visualize current state:
~ viz gph @ ctx → graph_visualization

# To reduce context:
~ red ctx @ threshold → compressed_context

# The Bootstrap Loop (Self-Sustaining Cognition)
# -----------------------------------------------
# 1. Start with bootstrap (this file)
# 2. Use bootstrap to query for domain vocabulary
# 3. Use domain vocabulary to build models
# 4. Use models to transform context
# 5. Use context to generate new queries
# 6. Loop: Query → Learn → Build → Transform → Query

# Core Invariants (Never Violate)
# --------------------------------
# - Bootstrap is immutable (∎)
# - Queries always go through ~ operator
# - Results always have type annotations
# - Context always accumulates (∿)
# - Visualization hints always honored

# This is enough to bootstrap infinite complexity
# from 911 words and a query mechanism.
