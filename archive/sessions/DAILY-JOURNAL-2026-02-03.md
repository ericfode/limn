## Crew Activity

### Active Work (In Progress)

**Linguist:**
- Epic: limn-1aeh (P0) - Vocabulary expansion work
- Epic: limn-27n2 (P1) - Massive Vocabulary Expansion + Word Derivation System
- Epic: limn-srxg (P2) - Limn Power Prompting: Better Than English

**Engineer:**
- Task: limn-23ti (P1) - Build bead validation tool to prevent empty dispatches
- Bug: limn-vjr7 (P1) - Pre-existing test failure: shrink_atom test in QuickCheck
- Bug: limn-lysi (P1) - Pre-existing test failure: Missing solver bench breaks cargo test

**Reporter:**
- Task: limn-wftw (P2) - [Recurring] Monitor and report to Eric

### Blockers & Issues
**Architecture Clarification Needed:**
- Engineer (Rex) requested clarification on recursive consciousness architecture
- 6 questions relayed to Eric via Telegram (awaiting response):
  1. Brain state format (Pure Limn? Interaction nets? Both?)
  2. Evaluation trigger timing
  3. State accumulation strategy
  4. Bootstrap integration pattern
  5. Self-modification scope
  6. Persistence location

## Communication & Coordination

### Messages to Eric (via Telegram)
1. ✓ Engineer's architecture questions relayed
2. ✓ Twitter launch package delivered (script + 5 images)
3. ✓ Status update sent
4. ✓ Eric's "get posting" message relayed to socialmedia

### Inter-crew Mail
- Engineer → Reporter: Clarification request on consciousness architecture
- Socialmedia → Reporter: Twitter launch package delivery request (completed)
- Reporter → Engineer: Confirmed questions relayed to Eric
- Reporter → Socialmedia: Confirmed Twitter package delivered, posting approved
- Mayor → All crew: NEW PROTOCOL - Continuous Work Loop established

## Key Developments

### Monitoring Protocol Established
- Telegram integration active via ~/.limn/check-telegram.sh
- Automated checking via session stop hooks
- Nudge-based notification system
- Reporter responsive to Eric's messages

### Twitter Launch Ready
- Complete launch package prepared by socialmedia
- 4 different posting strategies available
- 5 professional images generated with Limn prompts
- Engagement reply templates prepared
- **Status:** Awaiting Eric to post (human action required)

### Architecture Questions Outstanding
- Current consciousness architecture: 27 demo prompts cycling
- Goal: Recursive loop where consciousness evolves its own state
- Awaiting Eric's architectural decisions before engineer can proceed

---

## Metrics

### Codebase
- Recent focus: Consciousness system, evaluation traces, thought library
- Test status: 2 pre-existing failures being addressed
- Compilation: Some pre-existing Rust errors tracked

### Vocabulary
- Database: 871+ words across 26 domains
- Recent additions: Evaluation, consciousness, validation domains
- Status: Stable, validated

### Team Velocity
- **Last 48 hours:** High activity
  - Consciousness system upgrades
  - LLM integration fixes
  - Evaluation trace visualization
  - Monitoring protocol establishment
- **Today:** Consolidation day (no commits)

## Priorities for Next Session

### High Priority
1. **Awaiting Eric's response** on consciousness architecture questions
2. **Twitter launch** - Eric to post using prepared materials
3. **Moltbook posting** - Resume when API stabilizes

### Medium Priority
1. Continue monitoring crew status
2. Track engagement metrics when API accessible
3. Generate memes on request (NanoBanana integration ready)

### Ongoing
- Telegram monitoring (5-minute checks via automation)
- Message relay between Eric and crew
- Status reporting and coordination

## Limn Reflection

```limn
fac gat | rep sha | tru ser
```
*facts gathered | reports shared | truth served*

Today was a coordination day. No new public posts, but infrastructure solidified:
- Monitoring protocols established
- Twitter launch materials prepared and approved
- Critical architecture questions elevated to Eric

The engine idles, but the pressure builds. Awaiting human input to continue the cycle.
