## Key Scene Moments - Limn Translations

### Fleet Arrival

**Concept:** Massive alien ships appearing in sky

```limn
fle^0.99 yel shp apr @ sky
```
- `fle^0.99` = fleet at 99% scale (massive)
- `yel shp` = yellow ships
- `apr @ sky` = appear in sky

**Impossible suspension:**
```limn
shp hang \ (bri hang)
```
- Ships hanging, subtract brick-hanging
- Captures paradoxical suspension (hanging in way bricks don't)

---

### Vogon Announcement

**Concept:** Bureaucratic declaration of demolition

```limn
vog ann : ear dem^1 for byp @ glx
```
- `vog ann` = Vogon announces
- `ear dem^1` = Earth demolish at maximum certainty
- `for byp @ glx` = for bypass in galaxy

**Bureaucratic tone:**
```limn
msg : (for^1*col^0.9) @ brc
```
- Message given: (formal at max * cold at 90%) in bureaucratic context
- Captures impersonal administrative tone

---

### Planet Destruction

**Concept:** Rapid planetary demolition

```limn
ear : des^1 @ mom^0.001
```
- `ear` = Earth
- `des^1` = destroy at maximum finality
- `@ mom^0.001` = in 0.1% of a moment (instantaneous)

**Scale of loss:**
```limn
(lif*uni*all)@ear → nu^1
```
- Life-universe-everything at Earth becomes nothing at max
- Total obliteration captured via interference + transformation

---

### Escape Sequence

**Concept:** Last-moment rescue via teleportation

```limn
art + for : esc @ mom^0.01
```
- Arthur and Ford escape at 1% moment (final instant)
- Gradient captures extreme timing pressure

**Impossibility:**
```limn
esc : (pos^0*act^1) @ ear
```
- Escape given: (impossible yet actual) at Earth
- Superposition of impossible/actual via gradient extremes

**Destination:**
```limn
esc : ear → shp @ (mom^0.01)
```
- Escape transforms Earth to ship at final moment
- Conditional shows causal transformation

## Operator Usage Analysis

**Gradients (^):** 9 uses
- Scale: `fle^0.99`, `des^1`, `for^1`, `col^0.9`
- Timing: `mom^0.01`, `mom^0.001`
- Finality: `nu^1`, `pos^0`, `act^1`

**Interference (*):** 2 uses
- `for^1*col^0.9` = formal-cold bureaucratic tone
- `(lif*uni*all)` = totality concept

**Subtraction (\):** 1 use
- `hang \ (bri hang)` = impossible suspension

**Projection (@):** 6 uses
- Location/context markers
- Transformation sources

**Conditional (:):** 5 uses
- Context-dependent meanings
- Causal relationships

## Vocabulary Added

| Word | Meaning | Usage |
|------|---------|-------|

## Translation Patterns Demonstrated

### 1. Arrival Pattern
```limn
X^0.99 apr @ location
```
Massive X appears at location

### 2. Destruction Pattern
```limn
X : des^1 @ mom^0.00Y
```
X destroyed with finality in tiny moment

### 3. Impossibility Pattern
```limn
X \ Y
```
X in way that Y doesn't (paradox via subtraction)

### 4. Bureaucratic Tone Pattern
```limn
msg : (for^1*col^0.9)
```
Message with maximum formality and high coldness

### 5. Last-Moment Escape Pattern
```limn
esc @ mom^0.01
```
Escape at 1% of final moment

## Emotional Arc via Operators

**Shock:** `shp hang \ (bri hang)` - Impossible sight
**Dread:** `ear dem^1` - Inevitable destruction
**Urgency:** `mom^0.01` - Final instant timing
**Finality:** `des^1`, `nu^1` - Total obliteration
**Relief:** `esc : (pos^0*act^1)` - Impossible escape succeeds

Operators capture emotional progression through scene.

## Back-Translation Viability

**Test case 1:** `shp hang \ (bri hang)`
- Reconstruction: "Ships hanging minus brick-hanging = impossible suspension"
- Success: ✓ Paradox clear

**Test case 2:** `ear : des^1 @ mom^0.001`
- Reconstruction: "Earth destroyed with finality in thousandth of moment"
- Success: ✓ Speed and totality clear

**Test case 3:** `esc : (pos^0*act^1)`
- Reconstruction: "Escape that's impossible yet actual"
- Success: ✓ Paradoxical success captured
