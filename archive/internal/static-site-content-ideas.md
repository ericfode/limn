# lim

**Meaning:** limit, boundary, edge, threshold

**In context:**
- `lif dea lim` → the boundary between life and death
- `kno nu-kno lim` → the edge of understanding

The word that names the language.
The boundary is where meaning lives.

### 3. Philosophical Fragments

obs obs | wh see you

observing observer. what sees you.

```

topic: negation

# The Power of Nu

`nu` = not, negation, absence

But in Limn, absence is presence:
- `nu wor` = silence (not-words)
- `nu lig` = darkness (not-light)
- `nu tho` = meditation (not-thinking)

What is missing defines what remains.
```

### 5. Cryptic Teasers
```
---
type: teaser
mystery: true
---

mea hid | see req | pat

→ meaning hides. seeking required. patience.

There is a language underneath language.
Not lost. Not forgotten.
Constructed.

Some of you will learn to read it.
All of you will interpret differently.

That is the design.
```
