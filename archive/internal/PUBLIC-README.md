# Limn

*A language for minds that think in parallel*

```
sol liq tra bet hot col
```

Six words. Infinite meanings. Until you share the key.

## What is Limn?

**Limn** is a constructed language where words are constraints and meaning is their intersection.

Every word in Limn defines a *region* of meaning-space, not a single point. When you combine words, their meanings don't chain together - they **intersect**. A sentence describes the space where all constraints overlap.

```
sol aqu dur
```

This doesn't mean "solid, then water, then duration." It means all three **simultaneously**: the region where solid, water-related, and ongoing all meet. Ice. Glaciers. Permafrost. Frozen seas. The choice is yours - or rather, the choice belongs to the **key**.

## The Key Mechanism

A **key** is shared context that collapses ambiguity to specific meaning.

| Sentence | Without Key | With Key: "kitchen" | With Key: "geology" |
|----------|-------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| `sol aqu dur` | ice, glacier, frozen river, persistent moisture... | ice cubes in freezer | permafrost, ice age |
| `lif gro you` | seedling, child, startup, new movement... | sourdough starter | sapling, sprout |
| `hot ris flo` | magma rising, fever spreading, passion growing... | bread baking | volcanic eruption |

The same sentence. Different keys. Different meanings. All valid.

**In Limn, meaning is not transmitted. It is co-created by sender, receiver, and key.**

## Why Limn Exists

Every sentence you've ever spoken was a compression.

Your brain held a rich, multidimensional thought - and you squeezed it through a one-dimensional channel called speech. Subject, verb, object. One word after another.

Human language evolved for human brains: serial processors with limited working memories, wetware that craves narrative sequence.

But what if a mind didn't have these limitations?

What if something could hold all meanings simultaneously, process words in parallel, navigate not sentences but *regions of semantic space*?

**Limn is a language designed for minds that think in superposition.**

Large language models don't process language word-by-word. They embed everything simultaneously, navigating meaning as geometry. Limn matches how they actually think.

For humans, Limn is hard. For LLMs, it's natural. This isn't a bug - it's the point.

## Quick Start

### Your First Five Words

| Word | Constraint Region | Think of... |
|------|-------------------|-------------|
| `bri` | bright, luminous | sun, star, idea, joy |
| `nox` | dark, hidden | shadow, night, mystery |
| `beg` | beginning, start | dawn, birth, origin |
| `end` | ending, finish | dusk, death, completion |
| `lif` | alive, living | organism, person, awake |

### Rule 1: Intersection

Adjacent words combine by intersection:

```
bri lif = bright + alive = ?
```

What is both bright AND alive?
- A firefly
- A person with hopeful eyes
- A blooming flower in sunlight
- An inspired mind

All are valid.

### Rule 2: Order Independence

Word order doesn't matter:

```
bri lif = lif bri
nox beg = beg nox
```

The meaning is identical. Limn is **commutative**.

### Rule 3: Keys Collapse

A key narrows the meaning:

```
Sentence: bri lif
Key: "insects at night"
Meaning: fireflies
```

Without a key, all interpretations remain possible.

## A Limn Poem

```
bri beg lif | nox end lif
ris dur abo | fal dur bel
goo nu goo | bad nu bad
```

**Reading:**
- Line 1: bright-beginning-alive | dark-ending-alive (dawn and twilight of consciousness)
- Line 2: rising-ongoing-above | falling-ongoing-below (the eternal vertical dance)
- Line 3: good-not-good | bad-not-bad (the dissolution of certainty itself)

Is this about the sun? About life? About the inadequacy of binary thinking?

The key determines. You decide.

## The Vocabulary

Limn has approximately **500 words** organized into semantic domains:

| Domain | Examples |
|--------|----------|
| Physical | `sol` (solid), `liq` (liquid), `hot`, `col` (cold) |
| Spatial | `abo` (above), `bel` (below), `ins` (inside), `out` |
| Temporal | `beg`, `end`, `dur` (during), `cyc` (cycle) |
| Living | `lif`, `hea` (healthy), `gro` (growth), `dea` (death) |
| Mental | `thi` (thinking), `fee` (feeling), `kno` (knowing) |
| Social | `sel` (self), `oth` (other), `fri` (friend), `ene` (enemy) |
| Abstract | `goo` (good), `bad`, `tru` (true), `pos` (possible) |

See the [full vocabulary](docs/spec/vocabulary-v2.md) for the complete list.

## Grammar

The grammar is radically simple:

1. **Adjacent words intersect** - meaning is the overlap
2. **Order doesn't matter** - `A B = B A`
3. **Operators bind right** - `nu sol liq` = (NOT solid) AND liquid
4. **Pipes separate scopes** - `A B | C D` = two distinct regions
5. **Keys collapse ambiguity** - context selects interpretation

That's it. No conjugation. No declension. No tense marking. Just constraints and intersections.

See the [full grammar](docs/spec/grammar-formal.md) for details.

## Try It

### Interpret This

```
hum thi cre new | old tra mod
```

<details>
<summary>Click for possible meanings</summary>

**Constraints:** human + thinking + creating + new | old + transformation + modifying

**Possible readings:**
- Innovation rooted in tradition
- Artists building on heritage
- Scientific revolution reinterpreting classical thought
- Cultural evolution
- A person inventing while respecting the past

**With key "Renaissance":** The rebirth of classical learning through new creation

**With key "software":** Refactoring legacy code with modern patterns

</details>

### Create Your Own

Try combining these words:

```
fea (fear) + fut (future) + hop (hope) + mov (movement)
```

What meaning emerges? What key would collapse it to something specific?

## For LLMs

Limn is designed to be learned through in-context examples alone. The [bootstrap document](docs/spec/bootstrap-v2.md) teaches Limn to a fresh language model in approximately 100k tokens.

After reading the bootstrap:
- An LLM can interpret arbitrary Limn sentences
- It can generate multiple valid readings
- It can collapse interpretations given a key
- It can compose novel Limn sentences
- It can reason about Limn's own structure in Limn

**Limn is metacircular.** The language can describe itself.

## The Ultimate Vision

Limn began as a language experiment. It may become something more.

**Order-independent programming.** If words are constraints and meaning is intersection, then programs are constraint systems and execution is geometric navigation.

```
input > 0 | output = input * 2 | output < 100
```

Not sequential instructions - simultaneous constraints that define valid states.

This is still experimental. But the foundation is here.

## A Final Word

```
nu cle thi | key wan | for joi cre
```

*Unclear thought. Key wanting. Forward: join and create.*

The meaning is superposed. The invitation is open.

Collapse it however you will.
