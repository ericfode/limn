# Twitter Launch Script: Limn

> Voice: Mad coding monk. Eccentric but credible. You've seen something others haven't.

## Option A: The Thread (Recommended)

### Tweet 1/5 - The Hook
**Image:** `01-hook.png`

```
I built a language where meaning is constraint satisfaction.

3-letter words. No grammar. Just intersecting regions of semantics.

It's called Limn.

🧵
```

---

### Tweet 2/5 - The Problem
**Image:** `02-problem.png`

```
The problem: natural language is lossy.

You say "I'm fine" when you're not. Words point at meanings but never quite land.

What if words WERE the meanings? Not symbols for things. The things themselves.
```

---

### Tweet 3/5 - The Solution
**Image:** `03-solution.png`

```
Limn: words are regions. Sentences are intersections.

wor reg | mea int | key col

"words regions | meaning intersects | keys collapse"

Three constraints. One truth.
```

---

### Tweet 4/5 - The Example
**Image:** `04-example.png`

```
joy sad now

That's a complete thought in Limn.

Not "I feel happy and sad at the same time in the present moment."

Just: joy sad now

The meaning IS the intersection. Bittersweet. Right now.
```

### Tweet 5/5 - The Invitation
**Image:** `05-cta.png`

```
312 words. Open vocabulary.

Database: dolthub.com/repositories/ericfode/limn
Repo: github.com/ericfode/limn
Play: ericfode.github.io/limn/oracle/

sci sci | scry the scrying

If you see what I see, you'll know.
```

---

## Option B: Single Viral Tweet

**Use image:** `03-solution.png` or `04-example.png`

```
I made a language with only 3-letter words where sentences are constraint intersections.

joy sad now = bittersweet present
lux dim lim = twilight boundary
hum mac mer = human-machine merge

It's not poetry. It's not code. It's something else.

```

## Option C: Mysterious One-Liner Series

Post these over several days, no explanation:

**Day 1:**
```
wor reg | mea int | key col
```

**Day 2:**
```
joy sad now
.
Some things are easier to say in Limn.
```

**Day 3:**
```
lux dim lim

Twilight isn't a time. It's a boundary condition.
```

**Day 4:**
```
If you're curious: github.com/ericfode/limn

If you're not, these posts will keep being cryptic. That's fine too.
```

---

## Option D: The "I'm Losing My Mind" Angle

```
I've been building a constructed language for LLMs and I think I've gone too deep.

I dream in 3-letter words now.

wor reg | mea int | key col

It makes perfect sense. That's what worries me.

## Engagement Replies

When people ask "what is this?":

```
Limn. A constraint-based language where words are semantic regions and sentences are their intersection.

joy sad now = the region where joy, sadness, and present-moment overlap.

Bittersweet. In 3 words.
```

When people say "this is cool":

```
sci ack | gra ext

(scry acknowledged | gratitude extended)

Try it: ericfode.github.io/limn/oracle/
```

When people say "this is weird":

```
wor new | fee str | und com

(words new | feeling strange | understanding comes)

Give it time. Or don't. Either way.
```
