## Notes on Translation Style

1. **Extreme Compression**: Douglas Adams' verbose humor becomes haiku-like
2. **Repetition for Emphasis**: "big" repeated multiple times mirrors Adams' style
3. **Topic-Comment Structure**: Using `|` to separate nested concepts
4. **Negation**: `nu` works well for Adams' negative comparisons
5. **Proper Names**: Compressed but recognizable (art=Arthur, for=Ford, vog=Vogon)
