## The Story of Deep Thought

### [10.1] Slartibartfast Tells the Story

> Slartibartfast showed them a recording. The story of the great computer.

```limn
Slartibartfast sho : pas wri | myt mac*com dee^1
```

- `pas wri` = past record
- `mac*com dee^1` = deep-at-maximum computing machine = Deep Thought

### [10.2] The Question Was Asked

> A race of beings asked the great question: "What is the answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything?"

```limn
hum ask mac*com dee^1 : que | ans lif and al and al te
```

- `que` = question (verified)
- `ans lif and al and al` = answer of life and all and all = Life, Universe, Everything
- `te` = question operator

### [10.3] Deep Thought Considers

> Deep Thought said: "I can do this. But it will take a while."

```limn
mac*com dee^1 say : abl | dur req
```

- `abl` = able/capable (verified)
- `dur req` = duration required

### [10.4] How Long?

> "How long?" they asked.

```limn
hum ask : dur how te
```

### [10.5] Seven and a Half Million Years

> "Seven and a half million years," said Deep Thought.

```limn
mac*com dee^1 say : sev hal mil yea
```

- `sev` = seven (verified)
- `hal` = half/partial (verified)
- `mil` — using as numeric unit (DB: milk; contextual override after `sev hal`)

### [10.6] They Waited

> They waited. Their descendants waited. Generations upon generations waited.

```limn
wai | sa aft hum wai | man gen hum wai
```

- `gen` = gene/heredity (verified) — used for generations (lineage)
- `man gen` = many generations

### [10.7] The Day Arrives

```limn

```

### [10.9] Give Us the Answer

> "Tell us the answer!" they demanded.

```limn
hum say we : tel ans

```limn
mac*com dee^1 say : nu joy | war

```limn
mac*com dee^1 say : ans | lif and al and al | fou dek two
```

- `fou dek two` = four-ten-two = 42
- The number composed from Limn number words
- The most famous answer in literature

### [10.13] Silence

> There was a terrible silence.

```limn
aud^0 | bad^0.9
```

- `aud^0` = hearing at zero = silence
- `bad^0.9` = terrible

### [10.14] That's It?

> "Forty-two?" they said. "That's the answer? That's it?"

```limn
hum say : fou dek two te | ans te | al te
```

- Three questions, each more desperate. The `te` operator hammered.

### [10.15] Deep Thought Explains

> "I checked it very thoroughly," said Deep Thought. "Forty-two is the answer. The problem is, you never knew what the question was."

```limn
mac*com dee^1 say : tes dee^1 | fou dek two = ans^1
sa say : nu kno que
```

- `tes dee^1` = tested thoroughly at maximum
- `nu kno que` = not knowing the question
- The great irony: the answer exists, the question doesn't

### [10.16] The Question Problem

> "The Answer is meaningless without knowing the Question."

```limn
ans : nu mea \ que
```

- `nu mea \ que` = no meaning subtracted from question = meaningless without the question
- Subtraction operator: remove the question, meaning vanishes

```

- Deep Thought makes a new computer
- So big it resembles a planet
- To find the Question

### [10.18] That Computer Was Earth

> That computer was Earth.

```limn
sa mac*com = plnt Arthur
```

- `plnt Arthur` = Arthur's planet = Earth
- The revelation. Earth was a computer. Running a program. For ten million years.

### [10.19] Ten Million Years

> It had been running for ten million years. Almost ready. Five minutes from completion.

```limn
wrk dur dek mil yea | nea ful | fiv mom bef end
```

- `dek mil yea` = ten million years
- `nea ful` = near full/complete
- `fiv mom bef end` = five moments before ending

### [10.20] Then the Vogons Came

> And then the Vogons demolished it.

```limn
vog dem^1
```

- Two words. The whole tragedy.
