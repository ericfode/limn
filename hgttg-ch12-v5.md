## The Standoff

```

- `sol` = stubborn/rigid (verified)
- `bac` = backward (verified)

### [12.2] The Mice Have Resources

> The mice had resources. Billions of years of planning. They weren't going to let one human brain escape.

```limn
sma org : str | man bil yea mak | nu des los bra
```

- `bil` not in DB — using inline for billions (context: after `man`)
- **Note:** Could compose as `man tho*tho*tho yea` but too verbose

### [12.5] Benjy Agrees

> "How about 'What's six times nine?'" suggested Benjy.

```limn

- The famous joke: 6 × 9 = 42 in base 13
