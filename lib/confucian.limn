## Notes
# Implementation notes, edge cases, open questions

### Extraction Limitations
This library was extracted primarily from experiment 010 which contains only 2 complete
Confucian examples. The extraction is therefore partial and should be expanded with:
- More examples from classical texts (Analects, Mencius, Great Learning, Doctrine of Mean)
- Specific instances of five relationships
- More detailed li (ritual) concepts
- Neo-Confucian developments (li as principle, qi as material force)

### Vocabulary Coverage
Core concepts captured:
- ✓ Ren (humaneness) - well validated (99.8%)
- ✓ Li (ritual/propriety) - defined but needs examples
- ✓ Junzi (exemplary person) - well validated (99.8%)
- ✓ Xiao (filial piety) - defined but needs examples
- ✓ Yi, xin, zhi, yong (righteousness, trust, wisdom, courage) - defined
- ✓ De (virtue/moral power) - defined
- ✓ Dao (the Way) - Confucian interpretation

Missing concepts:
- Specific virtues in detail
- Detailed ritual practices
- Music (yue) as cultivation tool
- Specific political reforms
- Education system details

### Semantic Coherence
Experiment 010 shows exceptional coherence (99.8%) for Confucian phrases using
Limn-native embedder, matching Buddhist (99.8%) and Daoist results.

### Pattern Interactions
Confucian patterns form hierarchical system:
- Self-cultivation (foundation)
- Family order (first application)
- State governance (extension)
- Universal peace (ultimate goal)

Key organizing principles:
- Reciprocity in all relationships
- Virtue by example, not force
- Ritual as cultivation method
- Names matching reality

### Cross-Paradigm Observations
Confucianism shares with:
- **Daoism**: Harmony, naturalness, non-forcing (but Confucian emphasizes li structure)
- **Buddhism**: Compassion (ren ~similar to karuna), moral cultivation
- **Aristotle**: Virtue ethics, cultivation through habit, teleology (social harmony)

Differs from:
- **Buddhism**: Affirms world and social roles vs detachment
- **Daoism**: Structured ritual (li) vs spontaneous naturalness (ziran)
- **Legalism**: Virtue-based vs law/punishment-based order

### Implementation Questions
1. **Mode switching**: How does `use lib/confucian` activate these relational patterns?
2. **Relationship modeling**: How to represent five relationships computationally?
3. **Context sensitivity**: How to handle context-dependent appropriateness (yi)?
4. **Graded concern**: How to model graded relationships (closer = more obligation)?

### Future Work
- [ ] Add more classical texts examples (Analects, Mencius)
- [ ] Expand five relationships with specific examples
- [ ] Add Neo-Confucian concepts (li/qi, xin as principle)
- [ ] Include music (yue) as cultivation method
- [ ] Add education and examination system concepts
- [ ] Document relationship to other Chinese schools (Mohism, Legalism)
- [ ] Test pattern composition with Daoist library (debate points)
- [ ] Validate against classical Chinese source texts
- [ ] Add specific historical exemplars (Confucius, Mencius, Xunzi stories)

### Historical Context
This library captures:
- Classical Confucianism (Confucius, Mencius)
- Core social and political philosophy
- Cultivation and education system
- Basis for 2000+ years of Chinese governance

It does NOT yet include:
- Neo-Confucian metaphysics (Song dynasty)
- Specific ritual details (Book of Rites)
- Political reform debates
- Modern New Confucianism

---

**Extraction Status:** ✓ Core library extracted
**Validation:** 99.8% semantic coherence (experiment 010)
**Completeness:** Partial - needs expansion from classical texts
**Next Step:** Validate and expand with more corpus
