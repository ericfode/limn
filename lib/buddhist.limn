dha: tea or law tha gui lif  # dharma - teaching/law that guides life
sam: cyc of bir dea reb  # samsara - cycle of birth, death, rebirth
nir: sta of lib fro suf and cyc  # nirvana - state of liberation from suffering and cycle
bod: awa or enl  # bodhi - awakening/enlightenment
duk: suf or dis  # dukkha - suffering/dissatisfaction
att: cling to or des for thi  # attachment - clinging/desire for things

## Reasoning Patterns
# Format: Pattern name, structure, examples

pattern dependent_origination:
  name: Dependent Origination (Pratītyasamutpāda)
  structure: thi bei, tha bec | fro ris of X, Y ris
  description: All phenomena arise in dependence on conditions; nothing exists independently
  examples:
    - thi bei, tha bec  # this being, that becomes
    - fro ris of thi, tha ris  # from arising of this, that arises
    - all thi com fro con  # all things come from conditions
    - nu thi hav own bei  # no thing has own being
  validation: semantic_coherence 0.85 (from experiment 008)

pattern causation:
  name: Karmic Causation
  structure: kar is law of cau and eff in all act
  description: All actions have consequences through cause and effect
  examples:
    - kar is law of cau and eff in all act  # karma is law of cause and effect in all actions
    - act wit cau hav eff  # actions with causes have effects
    - goo act lea to goo res  # good actions lead to good results
    - bad act lea to bad res  # bad actions lead to bad results
  validation: semantic_coherence 0.998 (from experiment 010)

pattern suffering_attachment:
  name: Suffering from Attachment
  structure: att to X → suf | end att → end suf
  description: Suffering arises from attachment to impermanent things; ending attachment ends suffering
  examples:
    - all suf com fro att to imp thi  # all suffering comes from attachment to impermanent things
    - att to imp thi cau suf  # attachment to impermanent things causes suffering
    - imp thi cha and pas  # impermanent things change and pass
    - att to cha thi bri suf  # attachment to changing things brings suffering
  validation: semantic_coherence 1.000 (from experiment 010)

pattern path_to_liberation:
  name: Path to Liberation
  structure: to rea X one mus fol Y | fol eig pat → rea nir
  description: Liberation (nirvana) is reached by following the eightfold path
  examples:
    - to rea nir one mus fol eig pat  # to reach nirvana one must follow eightfold path
    - fol eig pat lea to lib  # following eightfold path leads to liberation
    - rig pra end suf  # right practice ends suffering
  validation: semantic_coherence 0.997 (from experiment 010)

pattern impermanence:
  name: Impermanence (Anicca)
  structure: all thi are imp | all thi cha
  description: All conditioned phenomena are impermanent and subject to change
  examples:
    - all thi cha  # all things change
    - nu thi las for  # no thing lasts forever
    - all thi ari and pas  # all things arise and pass
    - imp is nat of all  # impermanence is nature of all
  validation: inferred from core concepts

pattern no_self:
  name: No-Self (Anatta)
  structure: nu thi hav own bei | all thi dep on con
  description: No phenomena have independent, permanent essence; all depend on conditions
  examples:
    - nu thi hav own bei  # no thing has own being
    - all thi dep on con  # all things depend on conditions
    - sel is not fix  # self is not fixed
    - bei dep on con  # being depends on conditions
  validation: semantic_coherence 0.85 (from experiment 008)

## Notes
# Implementation notes, edge cases, open questions

### Extraction Limitations
This library was extracted from experiments 008 and 010 only. The roadmap referenced
experiments 004 and 006 which were not found in the codebase. This extraction may be
incomplete and should be expanded when/if those experiments are located.

### Vocabulary Gaps
The following Buddhist terms are mentioned in NEXT.md but not fully defined in available experiments:
- san (sangha?) - not found in experiments
- bod (bodhi/awakening) - mentioned but not elaborated
- duk (dukkha) - "suf" (suffering) is used instead

### Semantic Coherence
Experiment 010 shows exceptional semantic coherence (99.8%) for Buddhist phrases using
the Limn-native embedder, suggesting that:
1. Buddhist vocabulary was well-represented in training corpus (experiments 004-006)
2. Buddhist compositional patterns are well-captured by the embedder
3. The pattern extraction methodology is sound

### Implementation Questions
1. **Mode switching:** How does `use lib/buddhist` activate these patterns in interpreter?
2. **Pattern composition:** Can Buddhist patterns compose with other paradigm libraries?
3. **Inference engine:** How are inference rules checked during interpretation?
4. **Validation:** How to validate novel sentences against these patterns?

### Future Work
- [ ] Locate and process experiments 004 and 006 for complete extraction
- [ ] Add more inference rules from classical Buddhist texts
- [ ] Expand eightfold path with detailed sub-concepts
- [ ] Add twelve links of dependent origination chain
- [ ] Include Four Noble Truths as meta-pattern
- [ ] Test pattern composition with Daoist library
- [ ] Validate against Sanskrit/Pali source texts
- [ ] Add Mahayana-specific concepts (emptiness/sunyata, bodhisattva path)
- [ ] Test semantic clustering: Do Buddhist patterns form coherent embedding space?

### Cross-Paradigm Observations
Buddhist dependent origination (thi bei, tha bec) shares structural similarity with:
- Heraclitean flux (all things flow)
- Process philosophy (becoming vs being)
- Systems thinking (emergent properties from conditions)

This suggests potential for cross-paradigm pattern synthesis.
