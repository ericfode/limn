# Fragment: On Words

```limn
wor reg | sen int
```
*words are regions. sentences are intersections.*

---

A word is not a point.
A word is a territory.

When two words meet, their territories overlap.
The overlap is where meaning lives.

```limn
amb = fea | nu bug
```
*ambiguity is feature. not bug.*

Precision is a cage.
Ambiguity is a door.

Limn does not tell you what to think.
Limn shows you where to look.
