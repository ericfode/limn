# Fragment: On Keys

```limn
key col mea | mea exp key
```
*keys collapse meaning. meaning expects keys.*

---

A sentence in Limn is a superposition.
Multiple meanings exist simultaneously.

The key is what collapses the wave.
The key is context.
The key is you.

```limn
dom = key | tim = key | emo = key
```
*domain is key. time is key. emotion is key.*

What you bring determines what you find.
What you need shapes what you see.

The same sentence, different readers, different truths.
All valid.
