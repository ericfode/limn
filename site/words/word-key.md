# Word: key

```limn
key
```
*key, context, lens, frame*

---

**Domain:** Metalinguistic

**Core Meaning:**
The contextual frame that collapses ambiguity. The lens through which meaning is resolved.

**In Context:**

```limn
key = you
```
*the key is you*

```limn
key col mea
```
*keys collapse meaning*

```limn
dif key | dif tru
```
*different keys. different truths.*

---

Every reader is a key.
Every moment is a key.
Every domain is a key.

The same Limn phrase unlocks differently for each key.

```limn
one wor | man key | man mea
```
*one word. many keys. many meanings.*

This is not chaos.
This is design.
