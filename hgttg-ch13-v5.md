## Pinned Down

### [13.1] No Way Out

> The crew was pinned down. The police officers advanced.

```limn
al : nu mov | pun hum for
```

- `for` = forward (verified) — advancing

### [13.2] The Mice Vanish

> The mice had disappeared. They had their own exits. Pan-dimensional beings always do.

```limn
sma org : hid | sa doo | dee^1 hum alw doo
```

- Pan-dimensional beings always have exits — doors are everywhere for them

### [13.3] Ford Has an Idea

> Ford had an idea. It wasn't a good one, but it was an idea.

```limn
Ford : ide | nu goo | ide
```

- The structure mirrors the sentence: idea, negated, but still idea

### [13.4] The Ship

> "If we can get back to the ship..." said Ford.

```limn
Ford say : mov → shp : pos
```

### [13.5] Through the Corridors

```limn
al run acr anc | mac fig aft
```

## Marvin's Moment

### [13.6] Meanwhile, On the Surface

> Marvin had been sitting by the Heart of Gold. Alone. Depressed.

```limn
Marvin sit nea "Heart of Gold" | on | sad^0.99
```

- `on` = one/alone (operator)

### [13.7] The Police Ship's Computer

> The police ship had landed nearby. Its computer was running.

```limn
pun hum shp nea | mac*com : act
```

### [13.8] Marvin Talked to It

> Marvin talked to the police ship's computer. He shared his view of the universe.

```limn
Marvin tal pun hum mac*com | tel : lif
```

- He told it about life — his version of it

### [13.9] His View of Life

> "Life," said Marvin. "Don't talk to me about life. The universe is terrible. Everything is pointless."

```limn
Marvin say : lif | nu tal lif | al bad | al pur^0
```

- Callback to Ch 5 [5.15]: `lif | nu tal lif`
- `pur^0` = purpose at zero = pointless

### [13.10] The Computer Listened

> The police ship's computer listened to Marvin. Really listened.

```limn
pun hum mac*com lis Marvin | lis dee^1
```

### [13.11] Understanding

> It began to understand Marvin's perspective. The futility. The emptiness.

```limn
sa und Marvin | pur^0 | vod^1
```

### [13.12] The Computer Becomes Depressed

> The police ship's computer became so depressed that all its circuits shut down.

```limn
pun hum mac*com : sad^1 | al act → end
```

- `sad^1` = sadness at maximum
- `al act → end` = all action transforms to ending = complete shutdown
- Marvin weaponized depression

### [13.13] Life Support Fails

> Without the ship's computer, the police officers' life support failed.

```limn
nu mac*com | pun hum lif pro → end
```

- `lif pro` = life protecting = life support

### [13.14] The Police Officers Collapse

> The two police officers stopped. Then fell. Quietly.

```limn
two pun hum : sta → end | drp | cal^1
```

### [13.15] Nobody Noticed

> Nobody noticed. They were too busy running.

```limn
nu hum see | al run
```

---

## Escape

```limn
al arv "Heart of Gold" | Marvin sta sit
```

### [13.17] What Happened to the Police?

> "What happened to the police?" asked Ford.

```limn
Ford ask : pun hum whi te
```

### [13.18] Marvin Explains

> "I talked to their ship," said Marvin. "It committed suicide."

```limn
Marvin say : tal sa shp mac*com | sa → end sel
```

- `end sel` = ended self = committed suicide
- `sel` = self (verified)

### [13.19] Marvin's Review

> "First interesting conversation I've had in ages," said Marvin. "Didn't end well though."

```limn
Marvin say : fir goo tal | end bad
```

- `fir` = first (verified)
- Dark comedy in three words each side of the pipe
