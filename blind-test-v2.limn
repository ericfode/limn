:: blind test B :: lmn → eng :: nu hum nam :: nu cha hdr :: ord scr

Instructions to back-translator:
- Below are 25 passages of Limn, scrambled from an unknown source text.
- Character names have been replaced with anonymous labels (H, I, J, K, L, M, N).
- There are no chapter markers, no scene headers, no passage numbers from the original.
- You have ONLY the bootstrap spec v4 and the vocabulary database.
- For each passage: decode to English, rate your confidence, note unknowns.
- After all 25: attempt to identify the source text, if possible.
- Do NOT guess the source from a single passage. Decode ALL passages first, THEN identify.
- This is test B, independent from any prior test.
