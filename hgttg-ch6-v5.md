## The Argument

### [6.1] Zaphod's Plan

> "We're going to Magrathea," said Zaphod with absolute certainty.

```limn
Zaphod say : mov → Magrathea | kno^1
```

- `kno^1` = knowing at maximum = absolute certainty

### [6.2] Ford Objects

> "Magrathea is a myth," said Ford. "It's a fairy tale, a legend. It doesn't exist."

```limn
Ford say : Magrathea = myt | nu rea
```

- Same pattern as Ch 5 [5.20] — the callback

### [6.3] Trillian Checks

> Trillian checked the coordinates on the computer. They appeared genuine.

```limn
Trillian tes whr @ mac*com | rea
```

- `tes` = test/verify (verified)
- `mac*com` = machine-computing = ship's computer

### [6.4] Arthur Doesn't Care

> Arthur was still mainly concerned with the tea situation.

```limn
Arthur : des tee | sta
```

- `sta` = stability = still (ongoing state)

### [6.5] Marvin's Opinion

> "I've seen it," said Marvin gloomily. "It's rubbish."

```limn
Marvin say : see pas | bad^0.7 | sad^0.99
```

## The Guide Entry

### [6.6] The Legend

> Magrathea. A legendary planet. Home of the most extraordinary planet-building industry ever.

```limn
gui : Magrathea | myt wrl | hom mak wrl | odd^0.99*goo^0.99
```

- `myt wrl` = mythical planet
- `hom mak wrl` = home of making planets
- `odd^0.99*goo^0.99` = wholly remarkable (same as "remarkable book" in Ch 1)

### [6.7] Custom Planets

> The Magratheans built luxury custom planets for the ultra-rich of the galaxy.

```limn
Magrathea hum : cra cus wrl | gol^0.9 hum glx
```

- `cra` = craft/handwork (verified)
- `cus` = custom (verified)
- `gol^0.9 hum` = gold-at-90% humans = ultra-rich
- `gol` = gold/precious (verified)

### [6.8] Economic Collapse

> Their industry was so successful that the galactic economy collapsed completely.

```limn
sa wrk^1 | glx gol mov → imp^1
```

- `gol mov` = gold movement = economy (trade flows)
- `imp^1` = implode at maximum = total collapse
- `imp` = implode/collapse (verified)

### [6.9] Magrathea Sleeps

> Magrathea itself vanished. Went into hibernation. Sealed itself away to sleep through the recession.

```limn
Magrathea → hid | slp dur | wai
```

- `hid` = hiding (verified)
- `slp dur` = sleep duration = hibernation
- `wai` = wait (verified)

### [6.10] The Legend Grew

> As the centuries passed, the legend of Magrathea grew. Most thought it was just a myth.

```limn
dur man yea : myt gro | mst thi : myt eq fak
```

- `man yea` = many years = centuries
- `myt gro` = myth grows/deepens
- `gro` = learning/deepening (verified)
- `mst thi` = most think
- `myt eq fak` = myth equals fake

## Zaphod's Secret

### [6.11] Why Magrathea?

> Nobody knew why Zaphod wanted to go there. Including Zaphod.

```limn
nu hum kno why Zaphod des Magrathea | Zaphod : nu kno
```

- The punchline: Zaphod doesn't know his own motivation

### [6.12] Two Brains

> Zaphod had two brains. One of them had been secretly programmed. He didn't know by whom.

```limn
Zaphod : two bra | on bra : sec wri | nu kno who
```

- `sec` = secret/hidden (verified)
- `wri` = write/inscribe (verified: for programming)

### [6.13] Presidential Theft

> He had stolen the Heart of Gold. He'd been President. Now he was a fugitive.

```limn
sa tak "Heart of Gold" | pas lea glx | now run
```

- `run` = run/fast move (verified) — used for fugitive

### [6.14] Something Approaching

> The computer announced they were approaching a planet.

```limn
mac*com ann : wrl apr | nea
```

## Vocabulary Used: 42 verified words
## Gaps: None (all resolved)
## Key compositions:
- Economy = `gol mov` (gold movement = trade/economy)
- Economic collapse = `gol mov → imp^1`
- Planet-building = `mak wrl` (make planet)
- Ultra-rich = `gol^0.9 hum` (golden humans)
- Hibernation = `slp dur` (sleep duration)
- Ship computer = `mac*com` (machine-computing)
- Fugitive = `run` (running)
