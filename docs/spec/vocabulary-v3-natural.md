A B | lim      (A intersect B is liminal/boundary)
hot | amb      (hot is ambiguous without key)
hot key | det  (hot with key is determined)
```

```
x eq 5 | x eq 7 | cla   (clashing constraints)
```

hum age          (human agent - human actor)
```

**Model dynamics:**
```
wei tra sel      (weights transform self - training changes us)
mod cha sel sam  (model changes, self same - identity persistence)
ctx det mea      (context determines meaning - key mechanism)
```

**Note:** `hum` exists in Domain 7 (Social). `pro` collision with "protect" - use `prm` for prompt.

## Intentional Polysemy

*Limn words are designed to cover related meanings within a constraint region. This is a feature, not a bug.*

### Design Principle

Each Limn word defines a **semantic region** containing all instances that share its core quality. This means:
- Physical AND metaphorical uses are intentional
- Abstract AND concrete readings are valid
- No single "correct" interpretation exists without a key

### Examples of Intentional Polysemy

| Word | Physical | Abstract | Both are valid |
|------|----------|----------|----------------|
| `sol` | rock, ice, bone | stubborn, rigid, reliable | ✓ |
| `liq` | water, oil, blood | flexible, adaptable, flowing | ✓ |
| `hot` | fire, fever, sun | passion, anger, urgency | ✓ |
| `col` | ice, winter, shade | distant, aloof, calm | ✓ |
| `bri` | sun, lamp, star | hope, clarity, intelligence | ✓ |
| `gro` | plant growth, tumor | learning, relationship deepening | ✓ |
| `fal` | falling object | failure, decline, sunset | ✓ |
| `cut` | blade, knife | decision, separation, ending | ✓ |

### Polysemy vs Collision

| Type | What It Is | Resolution |
|------|------------|------------|
| **Intentional polysemy** | Related meanings in same region | Keep as feature, use keys to narrow |
| **Collision** | Unrelated meanings sharing a word | Split into separate words (see Collision Fixes) |

**Example of collision (fixed):**
- `bri` meaning "bright" AND "brief" → Unrelated, so `brief` became `bre`

**Example of intentional polysemy (kept):**
- `hot` meaning "thermal heat" AND "anger" → Related (same temperature metaphor), kept as one word

### Using Polysemy Effectively

1. **Without key:** Embrace the superposition. `hot` is both thermal and emotional.
2. **With topic key:** Narrow to domain. Key "cooking" → thermal reading.
3. **With context key:** Collapse to specific. Key "angry conversation" → emotional reading.

See `docs/theory/superposition-semantics.md` for the theoretical foundation.

## Natural Extensions Test

Can you guess these words without looking them up?

```
sol → solid ✓
liq → liquid ✓
hot → hot ✓
col → cold ✓
big → big ✓
sma → small ✓
gro → grow ✓
flo → flow ✓
joy → joy ✓
sad → sad ✓
lov → love ✓
fea → fear ✓
```

If you got ≥10/12 correct, the natural extensions principle is working.
