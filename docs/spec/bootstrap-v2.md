## Part I: Foundation

### What is Limn?

Limn is a language where meaning emerges from constraint intersection. Each word defines a region of possible meanings. Sentences combine words, and their meaning is where all regions overlap.

Without shared context, a sentence has many valid interpretations. With a shared "key" (context), ambiguity collapses to specific meaning.

**The Core Insight:** Words don't point to things - they circumscribe regions of meaning-space. A sentence is not a description but a constraint system.

| `ma` | maximizer - extreme degree |
| `mi` | minimizer - slight degree |
| `eq` | equalizer - same degree |
| `di` | differentiator - different degree |

#### Reference Operators

| `yo` | proximal - this, here, now |
| `an` | distal - that, there, then |
| `sa` | same-reference - aforementioned, it |

## Part III: Grammar Rules

### Rule 1: Intersection (Fundamental)
Adjacent words combine by intersection. The meaning is where all constraint regions overlap.

```
sol aqu = solid AND water-related = ice, glacier, frozen sea
lif gro = alive AND growth = growing plant, child developing, cancer spreading
```

### Rule 2: Order Independence (Commutativity)
Word order does not affect meaning. All permutations are equivalent.

```
sol aqu = aqu sol
lif gro you = gro lif you = you gro lif = you lif gro
```

**Why this works:** We're describing a region of meaning-space. Intersection is commutative. The set of things that are (solid AND water) equals the set of things that are (water AND solid).

### Rule 3: Operator Scope (Binding)
Operators (`nu`, `ve`, `so`, etc.) apply to the immediately following word.

```
nu sol aqu = (NOT solid) AND water = liquid water, steam
sol nu aqu = solid AND (NOT water) = dry stone, bone, metal
```

After binding, the operator-word chunk participates in commutativity:
```
nu sol aqu = aqu nu sol = [nu-sol] aqu = aqu [nu-sol]
```

### Rule 4: Scope Boundaries
Use `|` to separate entities or constraint groups.

```
sol aqu | lif gro = (solid water) BESIDE (living growth)
                  = glacier next to meadow, ice pond with fish
```

Without `|`, all words intersect into one entity:
```
sol aqu lif gro = solid AND water AND living AND growth
                = nearly impossible single entity
```

### Rule 5: Grouping with Parentheses
Parentheses create nested scope:

```
nu (sol aqu) = NOT (solid AND water) = anything except ice
(sol | liq) hot = (solid OR liquid) AND hot = molten metal, hot water
```

### Rule 6: Key-Based Disambiguation
The same sentence has multiple valid readings. A "key" (context) selects among them.

```
Sentence: lif gro joi com

Without key (multiple readings):
- Civilization developing
- Coral reef forming
- Family growing together
- Company expanding
- Movement gaining members

With key "biology": coral reef, bacterial colony, tissue regeneration
With key "social": community forming, movement growing
With key "business": company merger, team building
```

## Part VI: Self-Reference (Limn Describing Limn)

This section demonstrates Limn's metacircular property: the language can describe itself.

### The Nature of Limn

```
wor mea amb | def cle kno
```
- `wor mea amb` = word + meaning + ambiguous = words have ambiguous meanings
- `def cle kno` = definition + clear + knowing = definitions make knowing clear
- **Combined:** "Words are ambiguous; definitions clarify knowing."

### What a Sentence Is

```
man wor joi | mea cen bet
```
- `man wor joi` = many + words + joining = many words joined
- `mea cen bet` = meaning + center + between = meaning centered between them
- **Combined:** "Many words join; meaning is the center between them."

### The Key Mechanism

```
amb | def | amb les mea mor
```
- `amb` = ambiguity exists
- `def` = definition provided (key)
- `amb les mea mor` = ambiguity + less + meaning + more = less ambiguity, more meaning
- **Combined:** "Ambiguity; then definition; then less ambiguity, more meaning."

### Constraint Intersection

```
yo wor | an wor | cen mea sa
```
- `yo wor` = this word
- `an wor` = that word
- `cen mea sa` = center + meaning + same = the center meaning is the same
- **Combined:** "This word, that word - the centered meaning is unified."

### The Interpreter

```
wor man joi | def giv | mea one eme
```
- `wor man joi` = many words joining
- `def giv` = definition given (key provided)
- `mea one eme` = meaning + one + emergence = one meaning emerges
- **Combined:** "Many words join; definition is given; one meaning emerges."

### Self-Reference

```
yo | mea | yo
```
- This + meaning + this
- **Interpretation:** "This means this." Self-reference.

```
yo wor | an wor | sa mea
```
- This word + that word + same meaning
- **Interpretation:** "This word and that word mean the same."

---

## Part VII: The Key Mechanism (Deep Dive)

### What is a Key?

A key is context that collapses ambiguity. Keys don't change grammar or word meanings - they select which interpretation from the meaning-space is activated.

### Types of Keys

**1. Topic Keys**
Simple domain specification: "We are discussing biology."
```
Sentence: lif gro mov
Key: biology = cellular division, organism development
Key: society = population growth, cultural spread
```

**2. Narrative Keys**
Story context establishing characters, situation, stakes.
```
"A young wolf cub leaves its pack..."
Sentence: you fea awa | old str hom
Reading: young + fear + away | old + strong + home
Collapse: "The young fears leaving; the old strength is at home."
```

**3. Relational Keys**
Shared history between speaker and listener.
```
"Remember last winter?"
Sentence: col dur | yo joy an
Collapse: Specific shared memory of winter joy.
```

**4. Coordinate Keys**
Precise constraints: location, time, domain, method.
```
Key: "Tokyo, 2026, stock market"
Sentence: exp ris | flu anx
Collapse: Market expansion rising; fluctuation anxiety.
```

### Key Collapse Examples

**Sentence:** `hot col bet mov`
(hot + cold + between + movement)

| Key | Collapse |
|-----|----------|
| Meteorology | Weather front, storm development |
| Kitchen | Cooking, tempering chocolate |
| Emotion | Mixed feelings, ambivalence in motion |
| Engineering | Thermal cycling, heat exchange |
| Philosophy | Dialectic, synthesis emerging |
| Health | Fever breaking, temperature regulation |

**Sentence:** `lif dea tra | new old joi`
(life + death + transformation | new + old + joining)

| Key | Collapse |
|-----|----------|
| Biology | Metamorphosis, generational transfer |
| Religion | Resurrection, ancestor communion |
| Business | Succession planning, merger |
| Art | Renaissance, revival movement |
| Technology | Legacy system integration |
| Philosophy | Hegelian synthesis |

## Part VIII: Advanced Topics

### Contradiction Handling

What happens when constraints seem incompatible?

**Example:** `hot col`
- Seems contradictory: hot AND cold
- But meaning exists: lukewarm, thermal shock, simultaneous sensation
- The intersection is small but non-empty

**Example:** `lif dea`
- Seems contradictory: alive AND dead
- But meaning exists: zombie, dormant seed, virus (debatable life), philosophical states
- Edge of the constraint space

**Principle:** Very few constraint combinations are truly empty. Even apparent contradictions have liminal readings.

### Scalability

As sentence length increases:
- Short (2-3 words): Broad, many concrete readings
- Medium (4-6 words): Narrower, more specific
- Long (7+ words): Either very specific or so constrained it becomes abstract/systemic

**Example progression:**
```
lif = living things (broad)
lif gro = growing living things (narrower)
lif gro you = young growing living things (narrower still)
lif gro you hea joi = healthy young growing living things joining (specific)
lif gro you hea joi soc fre = healthy young growing living things joining freely in society (abstract: thriving civilization)
```

### Negation Scope Subtleties

Negation creates complement regions. But what's the complement of a vague region?

**Example:** `nu bri`
- NOT bright = dim, dark, hidden, invisible, metaphorically unclear
- The complement of vague is also vague

**Example:** `nu (lif gro)`
- NOT (alive AND growing) = dead OR not-growing OR non-living
- This is most things!

**Practical implication:** Negation works best on relatively crisp concepts.

### Cross-Domain Metaphor

Limn naturally supports metaphor through constraint overlap across domains.

**Example:** `hot ang ris mov`
- Physical reading: heated substance rising
- Emotional reading: anger rising, temper flaring
- Both readings are valid; the sentence IS the metaphor

**Example:** `col fea fre res`
- Physical: cold freezing, rest
- Emotional: fear freezing you, paralysis
- No translation needed; the sentence maps across domains

## Part IX: Limn vs. Natural Language

### What Limn Loses

1. **Word order semantics:** "Dog bites man" vs. "Man bites dog" are different in English, identical in Limn.

2. **Agent/patient distinction:** Who acts on whom must be inferred from key.

3. **Precise tense:** Beginning/ongoing/ending differs from past/present/future.

4. **Definite articles:** "The" vs. "a" collapses to operators `th` and `a`.

5. **Embedded propositions:** "I believe that she knows" requires complex scoping.

### What Limn Gains

1. **Order independence:** Any word can be first; emphasis through other means.

2. **Inherent ambiguity:** Not a bug but a feature for poetry, diplomacy, AI.

3. **Key-based precision:** Context-sensitive without grammatical complexity.

4. **Cross-domain unity:** Physics and emotion share vocabulary.

5. **Metacircular simplicity:** Can describe its own interpretation process.

### Translation Challenges

**English to Limn:**
"The old wolf taught the young pup to hunt."

Analysis:
- Agent: old wolf (teacher)
- Patient: young pup (learner)
- Action: teaching hunting

Limn attempt:
```
old wol tea | you wol lea | hun
```
- old + wolf + teaching | young + wolf + learning | hunting
- The scope boundaries preserve agent/patient distinction
- But word order within scopes still commutes

**Limn to English:**
```
sol liq tra bet hot col
```
(solid + liquid + transformation + between + hot + cold)

Multiple translations:
- "Phase change occurs between hot and cold temperatures."
- "Melting and freezing happen in the temperature range."
- "Matter transforms between solid and liquid states through temperature."
- "The boundary between hot and cold is where things melt."

All valid; key selects.

---

## Part X: Verification and Testing

### Bootstrap Verification Tests

If you understand Limn, you should be able to:

**Test 1: Generation**
Given `sol flo dur`, generate 12+ interpretations across at least 3 domains.

**Test 2: Collapse**
Given `lif gro dea cyc` and key "forest ecosystem", narrow to 2-3 specific interpretations.

**Test 3: Commutativity**
Confirm that `hot mov ris` = `ris hot mov` = `mov ris hot` by providing identical interpretation sets.

**Test 4: Operator Scope**
Explain the difference between:
- `nu lif gro`
- `lif nu gro`
- `nu (lif gro)`

**Test 5: Composition**
Create a Limn sentence for: "A hidden truth slowly becoming known."

**Test 6: Self-Reference**
Interpret `yo mea | an mea | dif | sa` in the context of "language about language."

### Novel Sentence Challenge

**Sentence:** `aqu lif mic flo | ter sol mac res | bet tra`

Parse:
- Segment 1: water + life + microscopic + flowing
- Segment 2: earth + solid + macroscopic + resting
- Segment 3: between + transformation

Interpret without key: ?

Apply key "groundwater science": ?

Apply key "philosophy of scale": ?

## Part XI: Appendices

### Appendix A: Quick Reference Card

**Core Grammar:**
- Words combine by intersection (AND)
- Word order doesn't matter
- `nu` negates next word
- `ve` intensifies, `so` weakens
- `|` separates scopes
- `()` groups explicitly
- Key = context that collapses ambiguity

**Common Patterns:**
- `yo ... | an ...` = here/this ... | there/that ...
- `nu X Y` = (NOT X) AND Y
- `X nu Y` = X AND (NOT Y)
- `beg ... end` = process from start to finish
- `X tra Y` = X transforming into/with Y

### Appendix B: Domain Quick Reference

| Domain | Example Words |
|--------|---------------|
| Physical | sol, liq, gas, hot, col, bri, dim |
| Spatial | abo, bel, ins, out, nea, far, cen |
| Temporal | now, pas, fut, beg, end, dur, cyc |
| Living | lif, hea, sic, you, old, str, wea |
| Mental | thi, fee, kno, bel, dou, rem, ima |
| Social | sel, oth, fri, ene, fam, lea, fol |
| Abstract | goo, bad, zer, one, man, all, pos |
| Operators | nu, ve, so, yo, an, th, a, \| |

### Appendix C: Common Errors

**Error 1:** Treating word order as meaningful
- Wrong: "sol abo means solid above, but abo sol means above solid"
- Correct: Both mean solid + above; identical constraint region

**Error 2:** Forgetting operator binding
- Wrong: "nu sol liq means not (solid and liquid)"
- Correct: nu sol liq means (not-solid) and liquid

**Error 3:** Ignoring keys
- Wrong: "lif gro MEANS seedling"
- Correct: lif gro could mean seedling, child, tumor, startup - key selects

**Error 4:** Expecting precision without key
- Wrong: "This sentence is ambiguous, so it's broken"
- Correct: Ambiguity is the design; precision comes from key

### Appendix D: Historical Inspiration

Limn draws from:
- **Predicate logic:** Constraints as predicates
- **Set theory:** Intersection as composition
- **Category theory:** Arrows as transformations
- **Natural language semantics:** Prototype theory, family resemblance
- **Constructed languages:** Minimalist vocabulary, regular grammar
- **Information theory:** Ambiguity as entropy, key as mutual information

## Conclusion

You have now encountered the full Limn vocabulary and grammar. To truly learn:

1. Practice interpreting sentences
2. Practice composing sentences
3. Develop shared keys with conversation partners
4. Explore edge cases and apparent contradictions
5. Attempt self-referential description
6. Compare Limn expression with natural language

**The Core Insight:**
> Words are not labels pointing at things.
> Words are regions encompassing possibilities.
> Sentences are constraint intersections.
> Keys collapse ambiguity to meaning.
> Language speaks about itself.

```
