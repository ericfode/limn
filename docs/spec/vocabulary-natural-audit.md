# Vocabulary Natural Extensions Audit

**Purpose:** Review each vocabulary word for "first-thought" alignment.
**Criterion:** Would a naive reader guess the meaning from the 3-letter form alone?

## Scoring System

- ✓ **Natural**: First-syllable extraction or obvious truncation
- ◐ **Semi-natural**: Requires Latin/Greek knowledge or some inference
- ✗ **Opaque**: Meaning not guessable, needs memorization

## Physical States

| Word | Source | Rating | Notes |
|------|--------|--------|-------|
| `sol` | solid | ✓ | Perfect first-syllable match |
| `liq` | liquid | ✓ | Perfect first-syllable match |
| `gas` | gas | ✓ | Full word |
| `pla` | plasma | ◐ | Scientific term, plasma TVs help |
| `gel` | gel | ✓ | Full word |
| `pow` | powder | ✓ | First syllable |
| `fib` | fiber | ✓ | First syllable |
| `cry` | crystal | ◐ | First syllable but could be "cry" (tears) |
| `org` | organic | ◐ | First syllable, but could be "organ" |
| `met` | metal | ✓ | First syllable |

**Refinement suggestions:**
- `cry` → Consider `cry` vs `xta` (crystal) conflict with emotion "cry"
- `org` → Works if context is scientific

**DECISION:** Replace `mag`/`min` size terms:
- `big` = large (full word)
