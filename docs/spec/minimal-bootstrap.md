# Limn Minimal Bootstrap

**Can you understand this without being taught?**

## Example 1: Physical States
```
sol aqu → solid water → ice
liq aqu → liquid water → water
gas aqu → gaseous water → steam
```

## Example 2: Transformations
```
sol tra liq → solid transform liquid → melting
liq tra gas → liquid transform gas → evaporation
col tra hot → cold transform hot → warming
```

## Example 3: Combinations
```
hot pyr → hot fire → flames, inferno
col aqu → cold water → ice water
bri lux → bright light → sunlight
dim nox → dim night → twilight
```

## Example 4: Actions
```
aqu flo → water flow → river
aer mov → air move → wind
lif gro → life grow → growing plant
```

## Example 5: Emotions
```
joy lov → joy love → happiness, celebration
sad fea → sad fear → grief, anxiety
hop bri → hope bright → optimism
```

## Example 6: Operators
```
nu hot → not hot → cold
ve hot → very hot → scorching
nu lif → not life → death, inanimate
```

## Example 7: Scope
```
hot aqu | col aqu → hot water | cold water → two waters, different temps
bri beg | dim end → bright begin | dim end → sunrise, hope dawning
```

## Example 8: Programming
```
whe a → where a (declare variable a)
whe b → where b (declare variable b)
a joi b sa c → a join b same c → a + b = c
```

## The Test

Without any vocabulary list, did you understand:
- `sol` = solid (from "solid")
- `liq` = liquid (from "liquid")
- `aqu` = water (from "aqua")
- `tra` = transform (from "transform")
- `bri` = bright (from "bright")
- `gro` = grow (from "grow")
- `joi` = join (from "join")

**If yes, the Natural Extensions principle is working.**

## Grammar in 4 Rules

1. **Words combine by intersection:** `sol aqu` = solid AND water = ice
2. **Order doesn't matter:** `sol aqu` = `aqu sol`
3. **`|` separates things:** `hot | col` = hot thing BESIDE cold thing
4. **`nu` negates:** `nu hot` = NOT hot = cold

## That's It

You now understand Limn. Everything else is vocabulary.

*Many words join, meaning centered between, knowing emerges.*
