## Part 1: Your First 5 Words (5 minutes)

Start with these five words. They're the most useful starting point.

| Word | Core Meaning | Think of... |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| `lux` | light, bright | sun, lamp, hope, clarity |
| `nox` | dark, night | shadow, darkness, mystery, unknown |
| `beg` | beginning, start | dawn, birth, origin, new |
| `end` | ending, finish | dusk, death, completion, done |
| `lif` | alive, life | animal, plant, person, awake |

**Memory tip:** These words form natural pairs:
- `lux` ↔ `nox` (light vs dark)
- `beg` ↔ `end` (start vs finish)
- `lif` stands alone (life)

**Note:** These are v3-natural words—designed to be recognizable from English/Latin roots (lux=Latin light, nox=Latin night, etc.).

## Part 2: How Limn Works (5 minutes)

### Rule 1: Words combine by intersection

When you put words together, the meaning is what they have **in common**.

```
lux lif = light + alive = ?
```

Think: What is both bright AND alive?
- Firefly (bioluminescent)
- Person with hope in their eyes
- A blooming flower in sunlight

**All of these are valid.** Limn doesn't pick one meaning—it describes a *region* of meaning.

### Rule 2: Order doesn't matter

```
lux lif = lif lux
nox beg = beg nox
```

The meaning is exactly the same. Limn is **commutative**.

### Rule 3: Keys narrow meaning

A **key** is context that helps choose which meaning you want.

```
Sentence: lux lif
Key: "fireflies in summer"
Meaning: → specifically fireflies
```

Without a key, all interpretations remain possible.

## Part 3: Practice Exercises (10 minutes)

### Exercise 1: Read these sentences

What might each sentence mean? (Multiple answers are correct!)

**A.** `nox beg`
<details>
<summary>Click for possible meanings</summary>

- Dark beginning → midnight, a nightmare starting
- Night start → evening, sunset
- Unknown beginning → mystery origin, deep past

</details>

**B.** `lux end`
<details>
<summary>Click for possible meanings</summary>

- Light ending → sunset, enlightened death, triumphant conclusion
- Bright finish → clear ending, visible completion
- Hopeful end → optimistic closure, peaceful death

</details>

**C.** `lif beg end`
<details>
<summary>Click for possible meanings</summary>

- Life + beginning + end → a complete life
- Living through start to finish → life cycle
- Life that begins and ends → mortal existence

</details>

### Exercise 2: Create sentences

Combine words to express these concepts. (Your answer may differ from mine!)

**A.** "Birth" (the beginning of life)
<details>
<summary>One possible answer</summary>

`lif beg` = life + beginning = birth

</details>

**B.** "Sunset" (the light ending of day)
<details>
<summary>One possible answer</summary>

`lux end` = light + end = sunset

</details>

**C.** "Mystery" (something dark and unknown)
<details>
<summary>One possible answer</summary>

`nox` alone works! Or `hid` (hidden) for emphasis.

</details>

## Part 4: Common Mistakes (5 minutes)

### Mistake 1: Expecting one "right" answer

❌ Wrong mindset: "What does `nox lif` mean exactly?"

✓ Right mindset: "What region of meaning does `nox lif` point to?"

`nox lif` points to things that are BOTH dark/hidden AND alive:
- Creatures of the deep ocean
- People hiding
- Seeds underground
- Secret thoughts

All are valid. Context (key) selects.

### Mistake 2: Thinking word order matters

❌ Wrong: "Is `lux nox` different from `nox lux`?"

✓ Right: They're identical! `lux nox = nox lux`

### Mistake 3: Translating word-by-word from English

❌ Wrong: "happy" → try to find a single Limn word

✓ Right: "happy" → `joy` (joy) or describe: `bri emo` (bright emotion)

Limn builds meaning from combinations.

## Part 5: Self-Check (5 minutes)

Answer these to verify understanding:

**Q1:** Does `beg lif` mean the same as `lif beg`?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**Yes.** Order doesn't matter in Limn.

</details>

**Q2:** If `lux` means light and `nox` means dark, what does `lux nox` mean?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

Both light AND dark at once:
- Twilight
- Dusk/dawn
- Boundary between light and shadow
- Ambivalence, mixed feelings

This is called a "liminal expression" in Limn!

</details>

**Q3:** Why might the same Limn sentence have multiple English translations?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

Limn words define constraint regions, not single points. The intersection of constraints includes multiple specific concepts. A key narrows to the intended one.

</details>

**Q4:** Create a sentence meaning "the end of darkness" (like dawn).
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

`nox end` = dark + end = end of darkness = dawn

Or: `nox end lux beg` = darkness ends, light begins

</details>
