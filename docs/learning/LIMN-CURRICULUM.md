## Overview

This curriculum teaches Limn through progressive immersion. Each lesson builds on the previous, moving from passive interpretation to active creation.

| Lesson | Focus | Outcome |
|--------|-------|---------|
| 1 | First Words | Understand word-as-region concept |
| 2 | Intersection | Parse multi-word sentences |
| 3 | Operators | Use negation, scope, and modifiers |
| 4 | Keys | Apply context to collapse meaning |
| 5 | Composition | Create original Limn |

---

## Lesson 1: First Words
### *wor = reg | reg = mea*

**Core Concept:** In Limn, words don't point to things—they define *regions* of meaning.

### 1.1 The Region Concept

In English, "river" refers to a specific type of thing. You might picture a river.

In Limn, `riv` (if it existed) would define a region:
- flowing
- water
- long
- natural
- between banks
- moving

Everything that shares these properties is inside the region. The word is the boundary.

### 1.2 First Vocabulary

Learn these 10 words:

| Limn | Region |
|------|--------|
| `sol` | solid, fixed, rigid, hard, stable |
| `liq` | liquid, flowing, fluid, adaptable |
| `hot` | hot, thermal, warm, passionate |
| `col` | cold, frozen, cool, distant |
| `bri` | bright, luminous, visible, clear |
| `dim` | dim, dark, hidden, subtle |
| `gro` | growth, increase, expansion |
| `dec` | decay, decrease, decline |
| `mov` | movement, motion, change |
| `sta` | stillness, stability, unchanged |

### 1.3 Exercise: Region Thinking

For each word, list 5 things that fit within its region:

**Example: `sol`**
1. Ice
2. Rock
3. A stubborn opinion
4. A reliable friend
5. Concrete

**Your turn: `liq`**
1. ___
2. ___
3. ___
4. ___
5. ___

**Your turn: `gro`**
1. ___
2. ___
3. ___
4. ___
5. ___

### 1.4 Key Insight

Notice: the same Limn word covers physical AND metaphorical meanings.

`sol` is ice AND a stubborn opinion.
`liq` is water AND a flexible attitude.
`gro` is a plant growing AND a relationship deepening.

This is not ambiguity. This is design.
The region contains all valid instances.

### 1.5 Lesson 1 Complete

You now understand: **wor = reg** (word = region)

---

## Lesson 2: Intersection
### *sen = int | int = mea*

**Core Concept:** When you combine words, their meanings *intersect*. The sentence means what all words share.

### 2.1 Two-Word Sentences

```
sol liq
```

What is both solid AND liquid?

The intersection:
- Ice (solid water, becoming liquid)
- Gel (between solid and liquid)
- Slush
- A transition state
- Something rigid becoming flexible

The sentence defines the OVERLAP of both regions.

### 2.2 Order Independence

In Limn, order doesn't matter:

```
sol liq = liq sol
```

Both mean the same thing. The intersection is commutative.

This is different from English where "dog bites man" ≠ "man bites dog."

In Limn, we're describing a region, not an action sequence.

### 2.3 Three-Word Sentences

```
sol liq tra
```

- `sol` = solid
- `liq` = liquid
- `tra` = transformation

Intersection: Things that transform between solid and liquid.
- Phase transitions
- Melting ice
- Freezing water
- Relationships becoming more/less rigid
- Ideas crystallizing or dissolving

### 2.4 Exercise: Parse These Sentences

**Sentence 1:** `hot col`
- `hot` region: ___
- `col` region: ___
- Intersection: ___

**Sentence 2:** `gro bri`
- `gro` region: ___
- `bri` region: ___
- Intersection: ___

**Sentence 3:** `mov sta`
- `mov` region: ___
- `sta` region: ___
- Intersection: ___

### 2.5 Answers

**`hot col`**: Things that are both hot and cold
- Lukewarm (between temperatures)
- Thermal boundary
- Mixed feelings (metaphor)
- Contrast, juxtaposition

**`gro bri`**: Things that grow and are bright
- Dawn (light growing)
- Blooming flowers
- Enlightenment
- Hope increasing

**`mov sta`**: Things that move and are still
- Apparent motion (stationary but seeming to move)
- Dynamic equilibrium
- A spinning top (moving but staying in place)
- Meditation (inner stillness, outer life)

### 2.6 Lesson 2 Complete

You now understand: **sen = int** (sentence = intersection)

---

## Lesson 3: Operators
### *ope mod wor | ope = pow*

**Core Concept:** Operators modify words to expand expressive power.

### 3.1 The Negation Operator: `nu`

`nu` means "not" and applies to the NEXT word only.

```
nu sol
```
= not-solid = liquid, gas, flexible, yielding

```
sol nu liq
```
= solid AND not-liquid = dry solid, powder, crystal

```
nu sol nu liq
```
= not-solid AND not-liquid = gas, plasma, abstract

### 3.2 Practice: Negation

Interpret these:

**`nu gro`** = ___
**`nu bri`** = ___
**`hot nu col`** = ___
**`nu hot nu col`** = ___

### 3.3 The Scope Operator: `|`

The pipe `|` separates parallel concepts or creates scope:

```
sol | liq
```
= solid BESIDE liquid (contrast, not intersection)

```
abo | bel
```
= above | below (the contrast itself)

```
gro | dec | cyc
```
= growth | decay | cycle (the pattern of alternation)

### 3.4 Intensifiers

| Operator | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `ve` | very, intensely |
| `so` | somewhat, slightly |

```
ve hot
```
= very hot, extremely hot

```
so gro
```
= slight growth, modest increase

### 3.5 Reference Words

| Word | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `yo` | this, here, now, proximal |
| `an` | that, there, then, distal |
| `wh` | what, which, question |

```
yo gro | an dec
```
= this grows | that decays (here vs there)

```
wh bri?
```
= what is bright? (question)

### 3.6 Exercise: Complex Sentences

Parse these:

**`nu sol | liq`**
= ___

**`ve hot col`**
= ___

**`yo sta | an mov`**
= ___

### 3.7 Lesson 3 Complete

You now understand: **ope mod wor** (operators modify words)

---

## Lesson 4: Keys
### *key col amb | amb = des*

**Core Concept:** Ambiguity is intentional. Keys collapse meaning to specificity.

### 4.1 The Same Sentence, Different Keys

```
gro exp bri far
```

Without a key, this sentence has infinite valid readings.

**With key "astronomy":**
- Supernovae expanding, brightening, infinitely distant
- The universe's expansion accelerating

**With key "gardening":**
- Seedlings reaching for distant light
- Plants growing toward the sun

**With key "economics":**
- Market expansion, bright prospects ahead
- Bullish growth trajectory

**With key "relationships":**
- Love growing, future bright, far to go together
- A connection deepening over time

### 4.2 Keys Are Context

A key is any context that narrows interpretation:
- A domain (physics, biology, finance)
- A situation (we're discussing your job)
- A relationship (between parent and child)
- A mood (hopeful, fearful, curious)
- A question being answered

### 4.3 Implicit vs Explicit Keys

**Explicit key:** Stated directly
```
Key: astronomy
gro exp bri far = supernovae
```

**Implicit key:** Derived from context
```
Person A: "How's your startup going?"
Person B: "gro exp bri far"
(Key is clearly "business" from context)
```

### 4.4 Exercise: Apply Keys

Sentence: `sol flo dur`
(solid + flowing + enduring)

**Key: geology**
Interpretation: ___

**Key: relationships**
Interpretation: ___

**Key: finance**
Interpretation: ___

### 4.5 The Power of Ambiguity

Why design a language that's ambiguous?

1. **Efficiency**: One sentence, many valid uses
2. **Poetry**: Meaning resonates across domains
3. **Privacy**: Without the key, others can't understand
4. **Flexibility**: Adapt to any context
5. **Parallel thinking**: Hold multiple meanings simultaneously

### 4.6 Lesson 4 Complete

You now understand: **key col amb** (keys collapse ambiguity)

---

## Lesson 5: Composition
### *cre lim | lim cre you*

**Core Concept:** Now you create. Express meaning through constraint intersection.

### 5.1 The Composition Process

To express something in Limn:

1. **Identify the essence**: What properties define your meaning?
2. **Select constraints**: Which Limn words capture those properties?
3. **Combine**: Create the intersection
4. **Test**: Does the intersection match your intent?
5. **Refine**: Add or remove words as needed

### 5.2 Example: "Ice melting in spring"

**Essence:**
- Solid becoming liquid
- Cold becoming warm
- Seasonal, cyclical
- Natural transformation

**Constraints:**
- `sol` - solid (the ice)
- `liq` - liquid (becoming water)
- `col` - cold (initial state)
- `tra` - transformation (the melting)
- `cyc` - cycle (seasonal)

**Composition:**
```
sol tra liq | col tra hot | cyc
```

Or more simply:
```
sol liq tra | cyc
```

### 5.3 Example: "A friendship growing distant"

**Essence:**
- Connection existed
- Distance increasing
- Relationship changing
- Sadness (maybe)

**Constraints:**
- `fri` - friend
- `gro` - growth (but of distance)
- `far` - distant, remote
- `tra` - transformation
- `sep` - separation

**Composition:**
```
fri gro far | nea tra sep
```
(friend grows far | near transforms to separate)

Or:
```
fri | far gro | sad?
```
(friend | distance growing | sad?)

### 5.4 Exercise: Compose These

**Concept: "The sun rising"**
Your Limn: ___

**Concept: "A difficult decision"**
Your Limn: ___

**Concept: "Peace after conflict"**
Your Limn: ___

**Concept: "Learning something new"**
Your Limn: ___

### 5.5 Sample Answers

**"The sun rising"**
```
lux ris | nox dec | beg
```
(light rising | darkness decreasing | beginning)

**"A difficult decision"**
```
cho har | pat man | one nee
```
(choice hard | paths many | one needed)

**"Peace after conflict"**
```
bat end | cal beg | sta aft mov
```
(battle ends | calm begins | stillness after movement)

**"Learning something new"**
```
nu kno tra kno | gro und
```
(not-knowing transforms to knowing | understanding grows)

### 5.6 Advanced: Poetry

Limn poetry uses line breaks and structure for rhythm:

```
beg | gro | bri
mid | cha | amb
end | dec | cle

(beginning | growth | brightness
 middle | change | ambiguity
 ending | decay | clarity)
```

The poem expresses the arc of any journey: bright beginnings, ambiguous middles, clear endings.

### 5.7 Lesson 5 Complete

You now understand: **cre lim** (create Limn)
