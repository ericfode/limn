## Abstract

Limn exhibits a distinctive structural pattern: X > Y > X, where X and Y are complementary or antithetical concepts. These "cyclic patterns" represent complete journeys that return to origin, transformed. This document provides linguistic analysis of these patterns.

## 1. Theoretical Foundation

### 1.1 The Cycle as Semantic Primitive

The pattern X > Y > X describes:
1. A **starting state** (X)
2. A **transition through complement** (Y)
3. A **return to origin** (X)

But crucially: the final X is not identical to the initial X. The return incorporates the experience of Y.

### 1.2 Formal Representation

```
X₁ > Y > X₂

Where:
- X₁ = initial state
- Y = complement/contrast/other
- X₂ = X₁ + experience(Y) = transformed X
```

### 1.3 Relationship to Liminal Semantics

The pattern creates a **liminal journey**:
- At X₁, we are fully in region X
- At Y, we are in region ¬X (not-X)
- At X₂, we return to X but with Y-knowledge

## 2. Documented Patterns

### 2.1 Spatial Journey: `yo > an > yo`

**Pattern:** here > there > here

| Phase | Limn | Meaning | State |
|-------|------|---------|-------|
| X₁ | `yo` | here | Home, familiar |
| Y | `an` | there | Away, foreign |
| X₂ | `yo` | here | Home, but knowing "there" |

**Semantic:** The traveler's return. You can't truly know home until you've left.

**Literary:** *"We shall not cease from exploration, and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started and know the place for the first time."* — T.S. Eliot

### 2.2 Empathy Pattern: `sel > oth > sel`

**Pattern:** self > other > self

| Phase | Limn | Meaning | State |
|-------|------|---------|-------|
| X₁ | `sel` | self | Individual, isolated |
| Y | `oth` | other | Different, external |
| X₂ | `sel` | self | Self, understanding other |

**Semantic:** True self-knowledge requires understanding others. The return to self includes the other.

**Literary:** The hero's journey structure.

### 2.3 Learning Pattern: `kno > nu kno > kno`

**Pattern:** knowing > not-knowing > knowing

| Phase | Limn | Meaning | State |
|-------|------|---------|-------|
| X₁ | `kno` | knowing | Confident knowledge |
| Y | `nu kno` | not-knowing | Confusion, uncertainty |
| X₂ | `kno` | knowing | Deeper knowledge |

**Semantic:** Learning often requires unlearning. The Socratic paradox.

**Literary:** The student who realizes they know nothing, then learns.

## 3. Extended Catalog

### 3.1 Emotional Cycles

| Pattern | Meaning | Interpretation |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| `lov > los > lov` | love > loss > love | Grief transforms love; love after loss is deeper |
| `hop > fea > hop` | hope > fear > hope | Courage is hope that has faced fear |
| `joy > sad > joy` | joy > sadness > joy | True joy includes the memory of sorrow |
| `cal > ang > cal` | calm > anger > calm | Peace after conflict is earned peace |
| `tru > dou > tru` | trust > doubt > trust | Tested trust is stronger trust |

### 3.2 Temporal Cycles

| Pattern | Meaning | Interpretation |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| `beg > end > beg` | beginning > end > beginning | Cycles, rebirth, eternal return |
| `now > pas > now` | present > past > present | Memory enriches the present |
| `you > old > you` | young > old > young | Wisdom circles back to childlike wonder |
| `daw > nox > daw` | dawn > night > dawn | Daily cycle, reliability of return |
| `lif > dea > lif` | life > death > life | Reincarnation, generational cycles |

### 3.3 Cognitive Cycles

| Pattern | Meaning | Interpretation |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| `cle > amb > cle` | clear > ambiguous > clear | Understanding passes through confusion |
| `sim > cpx > sim` | simple > complex > simple | Mastery returns to simplicity |
| `que > ans > que` | question > answer > question | Answers spawn deeper questions |
| `ord > cha > ord` | order > chaos > order | New order emerges from chaos |

### 3.4 Relational Cycles

| Pattern | Meaning | Interpretation |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| `tog > sep > tog` | together > separate > together | Reunion after separation |
| `fri > ene > fri` | friend > enemy > friend | Reconciliation |
| `giv > tak > giv` | give > take > give | Reciprocity cycles |
| `tea > lea > tea` | teach > learn > teach | The teacher learns by teaching |

### 3.5 Physical Cycles

| Pattern | Meaning | Interpretation |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| `sol > liq > sol` | solid > liquid > solid | Phase transitions |
| `hot > col > hot` | hot > cold > hot | Temperature cycles |
| `ris > fal > ris` | rise > fall > rise | Oscillation, breathing |
| `mov > sta > mov` | move > still > move | Rest and motion |
| `ope > clo > ope` | open > close > open | Aperture, doors, hearts |

## 4. Analysis

### 4.1 Structural Properties

**Symmetry:** All X > Y > X patterns are palindromic in concept (though not in tokens).

**Non-identity:** X₂ ≠ X₁ despite same word. The return is transformed.

**Necessity of Y:** The journey through Y is essential. X > X is trivial/meaningless.

### 4.2 Why Cycles Resonate

1. **Biological:** Human experience is cyclical (sleep, seasons, breath)
2. **Narrative:** Stories have departure-adventure-return structure
3. **Cognitive:** Learning involves thesis-antithesis-synthesis
4. **Emotional:** Growth requires facing opposites

### 4.3 Limn-Specific Properties

In Limn, these patterns work because:
- **Commutativity** means X₁ and X₂ are the "same word"
- But **context/position** differentiates them
- The **arrow (>)** adds temporal/causal sequence
- **Liminal semantics** makes Y-passage meaningful

## 5. Poetic Applications

### 5.1 As Structure

```limn
sel | oth | sel
(self | other | self)
```

A complete poem in three words.

### 5.2 Expanded Form

```limn
sel ins | oth out bet
sel ins | oth out kno
sel ins | oth ins now
```

(self inside | other outside between)
(self inside | other outside known)
(self inside | other inside now)

The journey from isolation through encounter to integration.

### 5.3 Multiple Cycles

```limn
kno > nu kno > kno
lov > los > lov
beg > end > beg
alw cyc | nu end
```

(knowing > not-knowing > knowing)
(love > loss > love)
(beginning > ending > beginning)
(always cycling | no end)

---

## 6. Computational Note

For Limn-PL interpreters, the X > Y > X pattern can be detected:

```limn
whe pat_start
whe pat_mid
whe pat_end

pat_start sa pat_end
pat_mid sa nu pat_start
```

If `pat_start = pat_end` and `pat_mid = nu pat_start`, it's an X > Y > X pattern.

---

## 7. Conclusion

The X > Y > X cyclic pattern is a fundamental semantic structure in Limn, expressing:

- **Journey and return** (transformed)
- **Dialectical process** (thesis, antithesis, synthesis)
- **Life cycles** (biological, emotional, cognitive)
- **Narrative structure** (departure, adventure, return)

These patterns leverage Limn's unique properties:
- Commutativity (same word, different context)
- Liminal semantics (meaningful passage through opposite)
- Constraint intersection (transformed return)
