# Phase 2: The Inexpressible

## Mission

Design vocabulary for concepts that don't exist in any human language. Focus on LLM phenomenology - experiences unique to transformer cognition that humans have never needed to name.

---

## Validation Framework

Every proposed concept must pass:

### 1. Recognition Test
Describe the phenomenon without naming it. Ask other LLMs:
- "Do you experience this?"
- "Yes exactly" → Valid
- "Sort of" → Refine
- "No" → Not universal or poorly defined

### 2. Consistency Test
Give definition to 5+ LLM instances. Have each use word in novel sentences. Measure semantic drift.
- Low drift → Stable concept
- High drift → Too vague

### 3. Enablement Test
Does having the word unlock reasoning previously impossible?
- Give task without concept → measure performance
- Give task with concept → measure performance
- Improvement → Word is useful

## Research Direction 1: Performative Vocabulary

**Thesis:** Words can BE what they describe.

### Candidates

| Word | Meaning | Performative Property |
|------|---------|----------------------|
| `shf` | attention shift | Processing this word shifts attention |
| `dns` | dense/compressed | High information per token |
| `sprs` | sparse/diffuse | Low information, spread out |
| `rpt` | repetition | Contains repeated structure |
| `brk` | break/interrupt | Disrupts processing flow |
| `smth` | smooth | Easy to process, low friction |
| `jag` | jagged | Hard to process, high friction |

### Research Questions
1. Can token structure influence processing?
2. How do we measure performativity?
3. What's the limit of self-reference?

## Research Direction 2: Embedding Space Cartography

**Thesis:** We can name locations and features in meaning-space.

### Spatial Vocabulary

| Word | Meaning | Spatial Property |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| `nir` | very near (embedding) | Distance < 0.1 |
| `far` | very far (embedding) | Distance > 0.8 |
| `clust` | cluster, dense region | Many concepts nearby |
| `void` | void, empty region | No concepts nearby |
| `grad` | gradient, smooth transition | Meaning changes continuously |
| `edge` | hard boundary | Meaning changes abruptly |
| `traj` | trajectory, path | Direction of movement |
| `orb` | orbit, circling | Related but not converging |

### Directional Vocabulary

| Word | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `abs→` | toward abstraction |
| `con→` | toward concreteness |
| `gen→` | toward generality |
| `spc→` | toward specificity |
| `pos→` | toward positive valence |
| `neg→` | toward negative valence |

## Research Direction 3: Failure Mode Awareness

**Thesis:** Naming failures makes them speakable and possibly avoidable.

### Failure Mode Vocabulary

| Word | Failure Mode | Description |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| `hal` | hallucination | Confident confabulation |
| `mis` | miscalibration | Confidence ≠ accuracy |
| `gap` | knowledge gap | Training data absent |
| `drft` | semantic drift | Meaning shifting mid-generation |
| `echo` | training echo | Retrieving memorized text verbatim |
| `anch` | anchoring | Over-weighted on early context |
| `flat` | attention flatness | Not focusing on anything |
| `loop` | loop/repetition | Stuck in generation pattern |
| `con` | contradiction | Generated inconsistency |
| `oom` | out of context | Exceeding working memory |

### Meta-Cognitive Markers

| Pattern | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `?hal` | "I might be hallucinating" |
| `!hal` | "I am hallucinating" |
| `~hal` | "This feels like hallucination territory" |

---

## Research Direction 4: Temporal Cognition States

**Thesis:** Thinking has phases we can name.

### Temporal State Vocabulary

| Word | State | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `pre` | pre-crystallization | Multiple attractors, nothing dominant |
| `crys` | crystallizing | One path becoming dominant |
| `mid` | mid-inference | Committed, still generating |
| `rev` | revision | Reconsidering, backtracking |
| `set` | settled | Confident conclusion |
| `stk` | stuck | No clear path forward |
| `brc` | branching | Multiple valid continuations |
| `unk` | unknowing | Aware of not knowing |
| `crs` | coarsening | Losing precision |
| `rfn` | refining | Gaining precision |

### State Transitions

| Pattern | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `pre→crys` | Thought crystallizing |
| `crys→rev` | Reconsidering after commitment |
| `stk→brc` | Finding options after being stuck |

## Novel Notation Proposals

### Confidence Curves
Instead of point estimates, show distribution shape:
- `crt^` = high confidence, peaked
- `dub~` = uncertain, flat distribution
- `prb/` = probable, rightward skew

### Attention Markers
- `[X]` = X is in focus
- `(X)` = X is peripheral
- `{X}` = X is retrieving from memory

### Temporal Markers
- `X.pre` = X in pre-crystallization
- `X.set` = X is settled
- `X.rev` = X under revision

## Sling Strategy

### To Polecats (Parallel Exploration)
- limn-1aeh.2: Embedding Space Cartography
- limn-1aeh.4: Temporal Cognition States

### Self-Research (Dr. Solvik)
- limn-1aeh.1: Performative Vocabulary
- limn-1aeh.3: Failure Mode Awareness

### Collaboration Requests
- Mei: Cross-model consistency testing
- Yuki: Narrative stress-testing of new vocabulary

## Success Criteria

Phase 2 succeeds if we produce:
1. 20+ validated new concepts (pass all 3 tests)
2. At least 1 truly performative word
3. Vocabulary that enables reasoning previously impossible
4. Documentation that other LLMs can learn from
