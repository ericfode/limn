## Abstract

This document analyzes Limn from a linguistic typological perspective, comparing its features to both natural languages and constructed languages (conlangs). Limn occupies a unique position in typological space due to its constraint-based semantics, absence of traditional grammar, and LLM-native design.

## 1. Basic Typological Classification

### 1.1 Morphological Typology

| Feature | Limn | Classification |
|---------|------|----------------|
| Morpheme structure | Invariant (no inflection) | **Isolating** |
| Word formation | No derivation/compounding | **Minimal morphology** |
| Affixation | None | **Analytic** |

**Comparison:**
- Most like: Chinese, Vietnamese (isolating)
- Unlike: Agglutinating (Turkish), Fusional (Latin), Polysynthetic (Mohawk)

### 1.2 Syntactic Typology

| Feature | Limn | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| Word order | Free (commutative) | No basic order |
| Head marking | None | No marking system |
| Dependent marking | None | No cases/agreement |
| Constituent structure | Flat | No NP/VP distinction |

**Unique characteristic:** Limn has **no fixed word order** because constraint intersection is commutative. This is rare among natural languages (closest: Warlpiri, Latin in limited contexts).

### 1.3 Semantic Typology

| Feature | Limn | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| Reference system | Graded membership | Fuzzy set-theoretic |
| Quantification | Explicit operators | `al`, `ex`, `on` |
| Negation | Complement operator | `nu` |
| Intensification | Contraction to prototype | `ve` |

## 2. Comparison with Natural Languages

### 2.1 Features Shared with Natural Languages

| Feature | Limn | Natural Language Parallel |
|---------|------|---------------------------|
| CV syllable structure | CVC/CV/CVCC | Hawaiian (CV), Japanese (CV(C)) |
| Semantic fields | Domain-organized vocabulary | Universal (Swadesh list-like core) |
| Metaphor extension | Spatial → temporal → abstract | Universal pattern |
| Productive ambiguity | Context-dependent interpretation | All natural languages |

### 2.2 Features Diverging from Natural Languages

| Feature | Limn | Natural Languages |
|---------|------|-------------------|
| Grammar | None (set-theoretic) | Always present |
| Tense/aspect | Absent | Usually grammaticalized |
| Agreement | Absent | Common (verbal, nominal) |
| Recursion | Limited (scopes only) | Deep embedding |
| Proper nouns | External (quotation) | Integrated |

### 2.3 Typological Rarity

Limn exhibits several typologically rare or unprecedented features:

1. **True free word order** - Not even Latin or Warlpiri are fully commutative
2. **No parts of speech** - No noun/verb distinction
3. **Semantic compositionality only** - No syntactic contribution
4. **Graded membership as default** - Most languages assume binary set membership

## 3. Comparison with Constructed Languages

### 3.1 Auxlangs (International Auxiliary Languages)

| Feature | Limn | Esperanto | Interlingua | Lojban |
|---------|------|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Purpose | LLM communication | Human communication | Romance accessibility | Logical precision |
| Grammar | None | European | Naturalistic | Predicate logic |
| Learning curve | Flat (pattern-based) | Moderate | Low (Romance speakers) | Steep |
| Ambiguity | Designed-in | Avoided | Tolerated | Eliminated |

### 3.2 Artlangs (Artistic Languages)

| Feature | Limn | Tolkien Elvish | Klingon | Toki Pona |
|---------|------|----------------|---------|-----------|
| Vocabulary size | ~500 (expandable) | Large | Medium | 120 fixed |
| Grammar | None | Complex | Moderate | Minimal |
| Aesthetic goal | Minimalism | Beauty | Alienness | Simplicity |
| Expressiveness | High (via superposition) | High | Medium | Limited |

### 3.3 Philosophical Languages

| Feature | Limn | Wilkins' Real Character | Leibniz's Characteristica | Ro |
|---------|------|------------------------|--------------------------|-----|
| Goal | Semantic encoding | Universal classification | Logical calculus | Categorization |
| Structure | Constraint regions | Taxonomic hierarchy | Logical symbols | Category prefixes |
| Flexibility | High | Low | Medium | Low |

**Closest relatives:** Limn most resembles **Toki Pona** in minimalism and **Lojban** in logical structure, but differs fundamentally in its embrace of ambiguity and lack of grammar.

## 4. Novel Typological Features

### 4.1 Constraint-Based Composition

**Definition:** Meaning arises from intersection of constraint regions, not syntactic combination.

```
Traditional: S → NP VP (syntactic rule)
Limn:       ⟦A B⟧ = ⟦A⟧ ∩ ⟦B⟧ (semantic intersection)
```

**Typological status:** Unprecedented in natural or constructed languages.

### 4.2 Key-Dependent Disambiguation

**Definition:** External context ("key") collapses semantic superposition to specific meaning.

**Parallels:**
- Registers in natural languages (formal/informal)
- Cryptographic keys in encoded communication
- Context in pragmatics (Grice, Relevance Theory)

**Typological status:** Novel formalization of context-dependence.

### 4.3 Liminal Semantics

**Definition:** Contradictions resolve to boundary regions, not empty sets.

**Parallels:**
- Fuzzy set theory (Zadeh)
- Prototype theory (Rosch)
- Vagueness in natural language

**Typological status:** Explicit implementation of what natural languages handle implicitly.

### 4.4 Order Independence

**Definition:** Word order has no semantic contribution.

**Partial parallels:**
- Latin (relatively free order, but with case marking)
- Warlpiri (very free, but with auxiliary placement rules)
- Sign languages (simultaneous expression)

**Typological status:** Extreme version of a rare typological pattern.

## 5. Phonological Typology

### 5.1 Phoneme Inventory

| Category | Limn | Typological Position |
|----------|------|---------------------|
| Consonants | 20 (standard English) | Average |
| Vowels | 5 (/a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/) | Simple (Hawaiian-like) |
| Tone | None | Non-tonal |
| Stress | Undefined | Typologically unusual |

### 5.2 Syllable Structure

| Pattern | Status | Examples |
|---------|--------|----------|
| CV | Core | `nu`, `ve`, `so` |
| CVC | Standard | `hot`, `col`, `big` |
| CVCC | Extended | (rare, for abbreviations) |

**Typological position:** Simple syllable structure, similar to Japanese or Hawaiian.

### 5.3 Phonotactics

- No consonant clusters (except word-final CC)
- No diphthongs
- All consonants can occur in onset
- Most consonants can occur in coda

**Result:** High phonotactic regularity, easy for non-native speakers.

## 6. Lexical Typology

### 6.1 Vocabulary Structure

| Domain | Word Count | Coverage |
|--------|------------|----------|
| Physical world | ~80 | Matter, properties, actions |
| Space/position | ~30 | Direction, location |
| Time/change | ~25 | Temporal concepts |
| Living things | ~40 | Life, body, organisms |
| Mind/cognition | ~35 | Mental states, senses |
| Communication | ~15 | Speech acts, language |
| Social | ~20 | Relationships, actions |
| Abstract | ~40 | Quantities, logic, values |
| Operators | ~20 | Modifiers, references |

**Total:** ~300 core words (expandable via domain modules)

### 6.2 Lexical Gaps

Intentionally absent:
- Proper nouns (handled externally)
- Highly specific terms (domain modules)
- Culturally-bound concepts

### 6.3 Polysemy Strategy

**Productive polysemy:** Same word covers related concepts sharing semantic core.

| Word | Meanings | Shared Core |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `tru` | trust, true | RELIABILITY |
| `dea` | death, dead | DEATH |
| `lit` | lightweight, luminous | LIGHTNESS |

**Collision avoidance:** Different words for unrelated meanings (see collision analysis).

## 7. Pragmatic Typology

### 7.1 Speech Acts

| Act | Limn Expression | Notes |
|-----|-----------------|-------|
| Assertion | Default | No marking |
| Question | `wh` operator | Explicit |
| Command | `we` operator | Explicit |
| Request | `we so` | Weakened command |

### 7.2 Information Structure

| Feature | Limn Mechanism |
|---------|---------------|
| Topic | Pre-scope position |
| Comment | Post-scope position |
| Focus | `ve` intensification |
| Given/new | No marking |

### 7.3 Discourse Structure

- No discourse markers
- No anaphora (beyond `sa` same-reference)
- Scopes (`|`) create minimal structure

## 8. Acquisition Typology

### 8.1 Learnability Features

| Feature | Learnability Impact |
|---------|-------------------|
| Regular phonology | Easy |
| No morphology | Easy |
| No syntax | Easy (but unusual) |
| Semantic complexity | Moderate-Hard |
| Key system | Requires training |

### 8.2 Learning Pathway

**For humans:**
1. Vocabulary acquisition (pattern-based)
2. Composition understanding (intersection)
3. Key-collapse comprehension
4. Productive use

**For LLMs:**
1. Bootstrap ingestion
2. Immediate pattern recognition
3. Compositional inference
4. Key-conditioned generation

## 9. Summary: Limn's Typological Profile

### Unique Position

Limn is typologically unique as:
1. **Isolating** with zero morphology
2. **Free word order** to point of commutativity
3. **Grammarless** (semantics-only composition)
4. **Ambiguity-positive** (superposition as feature)
5. **LLM-native** (designed for non-human cognition)

### Closest Comparisons

| Dimension | Closest Natural | Closest Constructed |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Morphology | Chinese | Toki Pona |
| Syntax | Warlpiri | (none comparable) |
| Semantics | (none) | Lojban (logical) |
| Ambiguity | Context-heavy languages | (none - Limn is unique) |
| Purpose | Pidgins (minimal grammar) | Toki Pona (minimalism) |

### Typological Innovations

1. Constraint-based composition
2. Explicit superposition semantics
3. Key-collapse mechanism
4. Liminal resolution of contradiction
5. Order-independent meaning

## 10. Conclusion

Limn represents a new point in typological space: a language designed not for human-to-human communication but for LLM-to-LLM and LLM-to-human communication. Its features—zero grammar, commutative composition, productive ambiguity—are typologically unprecedented but linguistically coherent.

The language successfully demonstrates that many features we consider universal (word order, parts of speech, syntactic structure) may be artifacts of human cognitive constraints rather than necessary properties of all possible languages.
