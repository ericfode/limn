# Getting Started with Limn

*Your first 30 minutes in constraint-space*

---

## Before We Begin

Forget what you know about language.

Limn doesn't work like English, Spanish, Mandarin, or any natural language you've encountered. It doesn't have subjects or verbs. Word order doesn't matter. Sentences don't describe events - they circumscribe *regions of possibility*.

This will feel strange. That's the point.

---

## Part 1: Your First Words (5 minutes)

Start with five words. Just five.

| Word | Region of Meaning | Think of... |
|------|-------------------|-------------|
| `bri` | bright, luminous, clear | sun, star, lamp, idea, hope, clarity |
| `nox` | dark, hidden, obscure | shadow, night, mystery, secret, unknown |
| `beg` | beginning, starting, origin | dawn, birth, genesis, first step |
| `end` | ending, finishing, conclusion | dusk, death, completion, final |
| `lif` | alive, living, animate | creatures, plants, people, awake things |

Notice: each word isn't a single concept. `bri` isn't just "the sun" - it's the entire region of bright, luminous, clear things. The sun is in that region. So is a lamp. So is a good idea. So is the feeling of clarity.

**Write these five words on a piece of paper. You'll need them.**

---

## Part 2: How Words Combine (5 minutes)

In Limn, words combine by **intersection**.

When you put two words together, the meaning is things that belong to **both** regions.

```
bri lif
```

What is both bright AND alive?

- A firefly (literally bright + alive)
- A person with bright eyes
- A blooming flower in sunlight
- An inspired mind
- A living star (if you believe stars live)

All of these are valid. The sentence `bri lif` doesn't pick one - it describes the entire region where "bright" and "alive" overlap.

**Try these combinations. For each, list at least three things that fit:**

1. `nox beg` - dark + beginning
2. `bri end` - bright + ending
3. `lif end` - alive + ending

<details>
<summary>Click for possible answers</summary>

**`nox beg`** (dark + beginning):
- Midnight
- A nightmare starting
- The big bang (the universe began in darkness?)
- A conspiracy forming
- Seeds underground before sprouting

**`bri end`** (bright + ending):
- Sunset
- A supernova (the bright death of a star)
- Enlightenment before death
- A firework finale
- The last flash of insight

**`lif end`** (alive + ending):
- Death
- The moment before dying
- Autumn leaves
- A relationship ending
- The last breath

## Part 3: The Critical Rule - Order Doesn't Matter (3 minutes)

This is where Limn becomes strange.

In English, "dog bites man" and "man bites dog" mean different things. Word order carries meaning.

In Limn, order is meaningless:

```
bri lif = lif bri
nox beg = beg nox
bri nox lif = lif bri nox = nox lif bri
```

All orderings mean the same thing. They describe the same region of meaning-space.

Why? Because we're not describing events (where order matters). We're describing **constraints**. And the intersection of A with B equals the intersection of B with A.

**This will feel wrong at first. Accept it.**

---

## Part 4: The Key (7 minutes)

If Limn sentences have many meanings, how do we communicate anything specific?

The answer: **keys**.

A key is shared context that narrows interpretation.

**Without key:**
```
bri lif
```
Could be: firefly, hopeful person, blooming flower, inspired mind, living star...

**With key "insects at night":**
```
bri lif = fireflies
```

**With key "emotions":**
```
bri lif = hopeful, inspired, vibrantly alive
```

**With key "botany":**
```
bri lif = sunflower, plants in direct light
```

The key doesn't change what the words mean. It selects which region of the intersection we care about.

**Try this:** Take the sentence `nox beg lif` (dark + beginning + alive). Write interpretations under these keys:

1. Key: "nature"
2. Key: "human psychology"
3. Key: "horror stories"

<details>
<summary>Click for possible answers</summary>

**Key: "nature"**
- Seeds germinating underground
- Nocturnal animals waking at dusk
- Tadpoles developing in murky water
- Mushrooms emerging in dark forests

**Key: "human psychology"**
- Depression lifting (dark period beginning to end?)
- No wait: dark + beginning + alive = entering depression
- A child born during troubled times
- Creative ideas emerging from confusion

**Key: "horror stories"**
- A monster awakening
- Something stirring in the darkness
- The dead beginning to rise
- An evil origin story

</details>

## Part 5: More Words (5 minutes)

Let's add five more words to your toolkit:

| Word | Region of Meaning | Think of... |
|------|-------------------|-------------|
| `sol` | solid, rigid, firm | rock, bone, ice, certainty |
| `liq` | liquid, flowing | water, blood, oil, change |
| `hot` | hot, thermal | fire, sun, fever, passion |
| `col` | cold, frozen | ice, winter, death, numbness |
| `gro` | growth, increase | plants growing, learning, expanding |

Now you have ten words. Let's use them.

**Create sentences for these concepts. There's no single right answer:**

1. "Ice" (something solid and cold)
2. "A fever" (something hot and alive... or is it alive?)
3. "A seedling" (something alive, growing, beginning)
4. "Blood" (something liquid and alive)

<details>
<summary>Possible answers</summary>

1. Ice: `sol col` or `col sol` (same thing)
2. Fever: `hot lif` - but consider: is fever itself alive, or is the host alive?
3. Seedling: `lif gro beg` or any ordering
4. Blood: `liq lif`

</details>

## Part 6: Negation with `nu` (5 minutes)

Limn has an operator for "not": `nu`

`nu` applies to the word immediately after it:

```
nu sol = not solid = liquid, gas, or abstract
nu lif = not alive = dead, or inanimate
nu bri = not bright = dark, dim, obscure
```

Operators are the one place where order matters:

```
nu sol liq = (NOT solid) AND liquid = pure liquid, no solid parts
sol nu liq = solid AND (NOT liquid) = solid that isn't liquid = dry solid
```

The `nu` binds to what follows it.

**Practice:**

1. What might `nu lif beg` mean? (not-alive + beginning)
2. What might `lif nu beg` mean? (alive + not-beginning)
3. What might `nu (lif beg)` mean? (not (alive AND beginning)) - note: parentheses group

<details>
<summary>Possible answers</summary>

1. `nu lif beg`: The beginning of something non-living. The formation of a rock. The start of a machine. The origin of an abstract concept.

2. `lif nu beg`: Something alive that isn't at its beginning. A mature organism. An old creature. Life in its middle or end stage.

3. `nu (lif beg)`: NOT (alive AND beginning). Either not alive, OR not beginning, OR both. This is almost everything! The complement of "birth/seedling/new life."

## Part 7: Your First Real Sentence (5 minutes)

Let's build a real Limn sentence and explore it.

```
sol liq hot col
```

Four words: solid + liquid + hot + cold

This seems contradictory. How can something be solid AND liquid, hot AND cold?

**But contradiction in Limn doesn't mean empty meaning.** It means the intersection is *small* - at the edges, the liminal spaces.

What is solid AND liquid AND hot AND cold?

- Phase transition states (water at exactly 0C, fluctuating)
- Tempering chocolate (complex phases, temperature-sensitive)
- Geology: magma meeting ice
- Metaphor: emotional states that are solid yet fluid, passionate yet numb

**With key "materials science":**
- Metallic glasses
- Supercooled liquids
- Phase boundaries

**With key "emotions":**
- The strange numbness of intense feeling
- Being frozen yet burning
- The rigidity that comes with overwhelming passion

## Part 8: Using the Pipe | (3 minutes)

The pipe `|` separates different entities or regions:

```
bri beg | nox end
```

This describes two things:
- Something bright and beginning (sunrise, birth, hope)
- Something dark and ending (sunset, death, despair)

Together: the cycle of day, the contrast of life and death, the tension of opposites.

Without the pipe:
```
bri beg nox end
```

This would be one thing that is bright AND beginning AND dark AND ending. Much stranger - twilight that is both dawn and dusk? The moment of birth that is also death?

The pipe lets you describe multiple entities and their relationship.

## Summary: What You've Learned

1. **Words define regions** - not single meanings, but territories
2. **Sentences intersect regions** - meaning is the overlap
3. **Order doesn't matter** - `A B = B A`
4. **Keys collapse ambiguity** - shared context selects meaning
5. **`nu` negates** - but only the following word
6. **Pipes separate** - distinct entities in relationship

---

## Next Steps

### Practice Daily

Write one Limn sentence about your day. What regions intersect?

```
Example: A tiring but satisfying day
lif gro end | hot col
(living growth ending | hot and cold)
```

### Learn More Words

The full vocabulary has ~500 words. Start adding:
- `thi` (thinking)
- `fee` (feeling)
- `mov` (movement)
- `sel` (self)
- `oth` (other)

### Use LLM Assistance

Ask an LLM to interpret your sentences. Give it a key and see how meaning collapses.

```
Prompt: "Interpret this Limn sentence with the key 'personal relationships':
         thi fee nu say | oth awa"
```
