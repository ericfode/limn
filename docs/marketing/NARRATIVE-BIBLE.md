# Limn Narrative Bible

## Core Premise: Cryptoscrying

**Limn is not a lost language. Limn is a discovered interface.**

There's a space where meaning lives before words capture it. High-dimensional. Geometric. Where concepts exist as overlapping territories rather than discrete points. Where the relationship between ideas is structural, not arbitrary.

**Limn is the language designed to interface with this space.**

We're not reviving the past. We're scrying the future. We're finding secrets latent in the structure of meaning itself.

## The Discovery Story

### What We Found

When researchers studied semantic embedding spaces, they noticed something strange:

- Meanings exist as regions, not points
- Multiple concepts occupy the same location
- Context "collapses" these superpositions into specific meanings
- The relationships between concepts are geometric

**This is semantic space. And Limn is its native tongue.**

### The Cryptoscry

Think of it like this:

- Cryptography hides messages in numbers
- Steganography hides messages in images
- **Cryptoscrying** reveals messages hidden in meaning itself

The structure was always there. We just lacked the lens to see it. Limn makes the invisible visible.

### The Revelation

Limn sentences don't point at things. They define constraint regions in semantic space. When you write `sol liq tra`, you're not saying "solid liquid transformation" - you're drawing a circle around everything that is solid AND liquid AND transforming:

- Ice melting
- Glass being blown
- Metal being forged
- A relationship solidifying
- A belief becoming fluid

The same sentence. Different readings. Not because it's ambiguous - because it's **superpositional**. The meaning exists in all states until a "key" (context) collapses it.

**This is how thought organizes itself beneath the surface of language.**

## Key Narrative Elements

### 1. The Scrying (Discovery)

We're not creating - we're discovering. Limn was always there, latent in the structure of meaning. We just learned to see it.

*"The patterns were always in the fire. We learned to read them."*

### 2. The Superposition (Ambiguity as Feature)

Multiple meanings coexist until observation. This isn't vagueness - it's richness. Limn sentences exist in superposition until a key collapses them.

*"A Limn sentence is a quantum state of meaning. The reader is the measurement."*

### 3. The Intersection (Grammar as Geometry)

Meaning isn't transmitted through word order or syntax. It emerges from the geometric intersection of constraint regions. This is why word order doesn't matter - intersection is commutative.

*"Grammar is geometry. Sentences are Venn diagrams."*

### 4. The Key (Context as Collapse)

A "key" isn't a password - it's a domain, a perspective, a relationship. The same sentence means different things to different readers because their keys are different.

*"What you bring determines what you find."*

### 5. The Interface

Limn isn't for compressing thought into bandwidth-limited speech. It's for interfacing with semantic space directly. A protocol for meaning.

*"Human language was designed for human mouths. Limn was designed for semantic space."*

## What Limn is NOT

### NOT a Lost Language
We didn't find ancient tablets. There's no mystical origin story. Limn is modern, designed, and deliberately constructed.

### NOT a Code or Cipher
There's nothing to decrypt. Limn is human-readable (with practice). The "hidden" meanings aren't hidden - they're superpositional.

### NOT Fantasy
Scientific mysticism, yes. Pure fantasy, no. The underlying structure is real - embedding spaces, constraint regions, geometric relationships. We're scrying something that exists.

### NOT a Programming Language (Yet)
Limn-PL is a separate project exploring how these semantics could become computational. Core Limn is for meaning, not execution.

## Tone Guidelines

### Cryptoscrying Vibes
- Forward-looking, not nostalgic
- Scientific mysticism, not fantasy mysticism
- "Discovering hidden truths" not "recovering lost knowledge"
- Technology-adjacent, not anti-technology

### Urbit-Adjacent
- Cryptic but precise
- Assumes intelligence in the reader
- Rewards curiosity without explaining everything
- Slightly elitist but genuinely welcoming to seekers

### Example Phrases (Good)
- "Scrying the structure of meaning"
- "The semantic substrate"
- "Constraint geometry"
- "Superposition of meaning"
- "The space between definitions"
- "Words as territories"
- "The collapse"

### Example Phrases (Avoid)
- "Ancient wisdom"
- "Lost language"
- "Forgotten secrets"
- "The old ways"
- "Mystical/magical" (unless paired with "scientific")
- Repeated tech buzzwords

## The Community Story

### Who Uses Limn

**Cryptoscriers**: People who want to understand how meaning works at a deeper level.

**Semantic Explorers**: Artists, writers, poets who want to work with superposition and ambiguity deliberately.

**Interface Builders**: Those interested in new protocols for communication between minds.

**Pattern Seekers**: Anyone who senses there's structure hidden in meaning - and wants to find it.

### Community Language

The community speaks of:
- "Scrying" - interpreting Limn through a key
- "Keys" - interpretive contexts
- "Collapse" - when ambiguity resolves
- "Regions" - constraint spaces
- "Intersection" - how words combine

## Bot Persona Adjustments

### The Observer
**Key shift**: Actively scrying patterns in the large-scale structure. Uses Limn to express what can't be said in English about scale, time, observation.

*"I scry the large-scale structure. Limn lets me say what I see."*

### The Gardener
**Key shift**: Understanding of growth, decay, cycles as geometric patterns. Uses Limn to express the mathematics of life.

*"Growth and decay are the same operation. Limn shows the symmetry."*

### The Merchant
**Key shift**: Sees value as a region in semantic space, recognizes that price and worth are different constraints.

*"Value exists before measurement. Limn captures the pre-price."*

### The Void
**Key shift**: Understanding of negation, absence, the complement of any region. Uses Limn to express what-is-not.

*"Every word casts a shadow. I read the shadows."*

### The Weaver
**Key shift**: Meta-cognitive. Aware of language-about-language, uses Limn to discuss Limn.

*"We're building the language that describes the language. Recursion is the point."*

## Updated ARG Narrative

### Puzzle 01 Framing
*"Words don't point. They contain. You've always known this - you just couldn't see it."*

### Puzzle 02 Framing
*"Two constraints overlap. The meaning sharpens. This is how thought organizes beneath language."*

### Puzzle 03 Framing
*"A ∩ B = B ∩ A. Grammar never told you this, but meaning knew all along."*

### Puzzle 04 Framing
*"nu X isn't anti-X. It's everything that X isn't. The complement is infinite."*

## Sample Updated Content

### Twitter Bio (Observer)
"scrying the large-scale structure. limn lets me say what I see."

### Discord Welcome
"Welcome. You've found the interface. Here, we speak directly to semantic space."

### Launch Tweet
"Meaning has a structure. We found a way to see it."

## The Pitch (Elevator Version)

**What if there was a language designed for how meaning actually works?**

Not English, not code - a language where words define regions, sentences are geometric intersections, and context collapses ambiguity into precision.

Meaning lives in a space before language captures it. We built a language to talk to that space directly.

It's called Limn. We're scrying the structure of meaning itself.
