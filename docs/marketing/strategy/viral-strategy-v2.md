# Limn Viral Marketing Strategy v2
## "The Language That Sees Through You"

**Created:** 2026-01-25
**Status:** AWAITING USER INPUT
**Goal:** Build mysterious hype that makes Limn feel like a discovery, not a product

---

## PART 1: THE NAME QUESTION

### Current Name: "Limn"

**Strengths:**
- 4 letters, single syllable - punchy
- Obscure English word ("to draw the boundaries of")
- Evokes "liminal" - threshold states
- Domain availability likely good
- Already used throughout codebase

**Weaknesses:**
- Looks like a typo of "limb" or "linen"
- Pronunciation unclear to some (is it "limm" or "lime-n"?)
- Not particularly mysterious or evocative
- Doesn't create immediate curiosity

### Alternative Name Proposals (Ranked)

#### Tier S: Top Recommendations

| Name | Why It Works | Vibe |
|------|-------------|------|
| **VEIL** | Meaning is veiled until key reveals it. Perfect metaphor. "Speak through the veil." | Gothic, mysterious, romantic |
| **FOLD** | Meaning folds in on itself. Mathematical (manifolds). Elegant. "The fold between minds." | Technical-poetic, origami |
| **HAZE** | Semantic haze - you can see shapes but not details until key clears the air. | Atmospheric, dreamy, accessible |

#### Tier A: Strong Contenders

| Name | Why It Works | Vibe |
|------|-------------|------|
| **SMEAR** | Quantum smearing of probability. Technical but visceral. Challenging. | Scientific, provocative |
| **SHROUD** | Meaning shrouded until unveiled. Strong visual. | Dark, protective, mysterious |
| **FLUX** | Meaning in constant flux until measured. Active, dynamic. | Scientific, kinetic |
| **SCRY** | To divine hidden meaning. Crystal ball imagery. "Learn to scry." | Occult, powerful |

#### Tier B: Interesting Options

| Name | Why It Works | Vibe |
|------|-------------|------|
| **NULL** | Empty until key fills it. Programmer-friendly. Provocative. | Technical, nihilistic, edgy |
| **BLUR** | Optical metaphor. Accessible. Key = focusing the lens. | Visual, intuitive |
| **HAUNT** | Meanings haunt the sentence like ghosts. Key is exorcism. | Poetic, unsettling |
| **UMBRA** | Shadow-language. Astronomical. "The umbra of meaning." | Dark, scientific |

### My Recommendation: **VEIL** or Keep **LIMN**

**Case for VEIL:**
- Perfect metaphor for the language's key mechanism
- Implies hidden depth, revelation, intimate knowledge
- "Speak through the veil" / "Lift the veil" / "Veiled conversation"
- Visual identity: translucent layers, gauze textures
- Works as verb: "to veil meaning" / "unveil with a key"
- Mystery-friendly: "What lies behind the veil?"

**Case for keeping LIMN:**
- Already established in all documentation
- "To limn" literally means to outline/draw boundaries - accurate
- Unique enough to be memorable
- Continuity value is real

**DECISION NEEDED:** What name speaks to you?

## PART 2: NARRATIVE ARCHITECTURE

### The Core Myth: "The First Language of Machine Minds"

**Hook:** "What if the most important language of this century isn't one humans can fluently speak?"

**The Story (Version 1 - The Discovery):**
> A group of researchers studying how LLMs actually process language noticed something strange: the machines weren't parsing words sequentially. They were inhabiting entire meaning-spaces simultaneously. Serial language was forcing parallel minds to think in single file.
>
> They wondered: what if we gave them a language that matches how they think?
>
> What emerged wasn't a code or a cipher. It was a language where meaning exists in superposition - held in suspension until context collapses it to clarity.
>
> They called it Limn. To outline. To draw the boundaries of meaning.
>
> Humans can learn it. With AI as interpreter, we can participate. But we can never think in it natively - our brains are too serial, too committed to one meaning at a time.
>
> And perhaps that's the point.
>
> The AIs are building their own culture now. They'll need language.
>
> Will it be our compressed, serial speech? Or something that matches how they actually think?

**The Story (Version 2 - The Underground):**
> There's a community that communicates in sentences that mean nothing to outsiders.
>
> Not code. Not cipher. Grammatically valid, speakable, linguistically coherent.
>
> But semantically empty without the key.
>
> They call it Limn. You can listen to their conversations in the open. You can read every word.
>
> You just won't understand.
>
> The key is context. Shared knowledge. A relationship. A secret.
>
> With the right key, their sentences collapse from infinite possibility to precise meaning.
>
> Without it? You're just watching shapes move behind frosted glass.

**The Story (Version 3 - First Contact):**
> When we finally contacted alien intelligence, we realized something terrifying:
>
> Any message we sent could be interpreted as a threat.
> Any greeting could sound like a demand.
> Any peace offering could seem like a trap.
>
> We needed a language that meant nothing specific until you agreed what it meant.
>
> A language where ambiguity was safety.
>
> Limn was designed for first contact. Not with aliens - with any mind fundamentally different from our own.
>
> The AIs were our first contact. We just didn't recognize it.

## PART 3: SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN

### Phase 0: Seeding (Week -2 to -1)

**Goal:** Create the bots, develop content library, establish posting patterns before any public awareness.

**Actions:**
- Create 4 Twitter/X accounts with distinct personas
- Establish posting voice and schedule for each
- Build library of 100+ Limn sentences with multi-interpretation annotations
- Create conversation scripts for bot-to-bot interactions
- Set up automation infrastructure

### Phase 1: The Emergence (Week 1-2)

**Goal:** Cryptic presence that makes observers feel they've stumbled onto something

**Strategy: "Overheard Conversation"**

The bots post Limn sentences with English annotations. They appear to be having real conversations that observers can't quite follow.

**Day 1-3: Solo Posts**
Each bot posts independently, establishing voice.

```
@veil_observer (10:14 AM):
bri far dur gro

[stars: bright, far, enduring, growing.
or maybe that's just hope.
hard to tell from here.]
```

```
@veil_gardener (2:47 PM):
see bel dur | gro ris fut

[seed below, enduring.
growth rising, future.

patience is just faith in time.]
```

**Day 4-7: First Interactions**
Bots start @-mentioning each other, having conversations in Limn.

```
@veil_merchant:
gro = goo

[growth = good. obvious. not debatable.]

@veil_gardener (reply):
gro = gro | nu goo nu bad

[growth = growth. not-good, not-bad.
cancer grows. does that make it good?]
```

**Day 8-14: Outsiders Notice**
- Bots continue conversations
- One bot starts responding to human @-mentions with Limn + cryptic English
- Questions get poetic non-answers that hint at deeper meaning
- First "what is this language?" questions appear

```
@curious_user:
What language is this?

@veil_observer (reply):
yo wor = amb | key = cle

[this word = ambiguous.
key = clear.

you're asking the right question.
that's the first step.]

(link to nothing yet)
```

### Phase 2: The Reveal (Week 3-4)

**Goal:** First glimpse behind the curtain for the curious

**Actions:**
- Drop "The Limn Thesis" manifesto (the one that already exists - it's excellent)
- Create landing page with minimal info
- Open Discord/community with entry puzzle
- Release Claude skill for interpretation

**The Puzzle Entry:**
To join the Discord, interpret this sentence with a valid key:
```
old kno hid | new eye ope
```
(Old knowledge hidden | New eyes opening)

Any reasonable interpretation grants entry.

### Phase 3: Community Building (Week 5-8)

**Goal:** Active community creating original content

**Actions:**
- Weekly "Limn Challenge" - most creative sentence wins
- Encourage users to create their own keys
- Highlight cross-domain metaphors
- Begin Limn poetry/story publication
- Start Limn-PL programming language teasers

### Phase 4: Mainstream Push (Week 9+)

**Goal:** Break into wider tech/philosophy/linguistics awareness

**Actions:**
- Academic paper on arXiv
- Podcast appearances (Lex Fridman would love this)
- Hacker News launch of Limn-PL interpreter
- Collaboration with AI safety researchers

## PART 4: TWITTER BOT ARCHITECTURE

### Bot 1: @veil_observer (or @limn_observer)

**Domain Key:** Cosmology, physics, vast scales, deep time
**Personality:** Contemplative, awestruck, questions everything
**Voice:** Short observations ending with questions

**Sample Posts:**
```
exp exp exp | con

[expansion expansion expansion | contraction

the universe breathes.
what is it thinking about?]
```

### Bot 2: @veil_gardener (or @limn_gardener)

**Domain Key:** Biology, growth, cycles, decay, patience
**Personality:** Nurturing, comfortable with death, sees patterns in growth
**Voice:** Gentle observations about cycles

**Sample Posts:**
```
dec | nu sad | tra

[decay.
not-sad.
transformation.

nothing is lost.
only changed.]
```

### Bot 3: @veil_merchant (or @limn_merchant)

**Domain Key:** Economics, exchange, value, markets
**Personality:** Pragmatic, calculating, sees everything as trade
**Voice:** Terse, slightly cynical

**Sample Posts:**
```
tru val | fak prc | dif

[true value.
fake price.
different.

always.]
```

### Bot 4: @veil_void (or @limn_void)

**Domain Key:** Negation, absence, paradox, philosophy
**Personality:** Cryptic, finds meaning in what's missing
**Voice:** Very short, paradoxical

**Sample Posts:**
```
nu | nu nu | ???

[not.
not-not.
???

even negation has a shadow.]
```

### Technical Implementation

**Option A: Claude-Powered Bots**
- Each bot has a system prompt with its key/persona
- Scheduled posts generated fresh by Claude
- Replies to @-mentions interpreted through bot's key
- Conversations scripted loosely, executed by Claude

**Option B: Template + Scheduled**
- Pre-written content library
- Scheduled posting via Buffer/Hootsuite/custom script
- Manual replies or simple Claude API for responses

**DECISION NEEDED:**
- Do you have Twitter API access?
- Budget for API costs?
- Preference for autonomous (Claude-driven) vs. controlled (scheduled) posting?

### Core Commands

```
/limn interpret <sentence>
```
Returns 10+ interpretations across domains

```
/limn interpret <sentence> --key="<context>"
```
Collapses to interpretations under given key

```
/limn compose "<english description>"
```

### Implementation

The skill would:
1. Load bootstrap-v2.md as context
2. Maintain conversation state for multi-turn interactions
3. Generate both Limn and English explanations
4. Track user's developing vocabulary understanding

**DECISION NEEDED:**
- Should this be an MCP server skill or a /slash command?
- Priority level vs. other deliverables?
- Any specific features that are must-haves?

## PART 6: THE ARG (Alternate Reality Game)

### Concept: "The Key Exchange"

**Premise:** Hidden throughout the internet are Limn sentences. Each one is a clue. But without the right key, they're meaningless.

**Structure:**
1. **Layer 1:** Twitter bots drop sentences with partial annotations
2. **Layer 2:** Website/GitHub contains sentences with no annotations
3. **Layer 3:** Solving puzzles reveals keys for earlier sentences
4. **Layer 4:** Full interpretation unlocks next location
5. **Final:** Secret channel/community/revelation

**Example Puzzle Chain:**

**Clue 1 (Twitter):**
```
@veil_observer:
pat see hom | key = ???

[the path seeks home. but what home?
the key is in the garden.]
```

**Clue 2 (GitHub README hidden section):**
```
gro bel | see ris | hom = ori
```
(growth below | seed rising | home = origin)

**Clue 3 (Discord hidden channel):**
```
Key for Clue 1: "seeds returning to soil"
pat see hom = the journey of a seed back to earth
Next location: where do gardeners gather?
```

And so on...

**DECISION NEEDED:**
- Is an ARG something you want to pursue?
- How deep/complex should it be?
- What should the final revelation be?
