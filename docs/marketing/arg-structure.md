# Project Limn: ARG Campaign Structure

**Codename:** THE INTERSECTION
**Tagline:** *Meaning has a structure. We found a way to see it.*
**Tone:** Mysterious, cryptic, intellectually rewarding - cryptoscrying vibes

---

## Campaign Overview

### The Narrative Frame

A new interface has been discovered. Not a technology, but a language - designed to interface with semantic space directly. Where meaning lives before words capture it. Fragments are appearing across the internet. Those who solve them find... more fragments. And slowly, a pattern emerges.

The truth: There's a space where meaning exists as regions, not points. Where concepts overlap and intersect geometrically. We built a language to scry that space.

**Who is behind this?** The messages never say. Some fragments reference "The Limnographers." Others suggest the structure was always there, waiting to be seen.

### Core Philosophy

Each puzzle teaches a Limn concept while maintaining the cryptoscrying mystery. Players should:
1. Feel like they're scrying hidden structure
2. Learn Limn organically through solving
3. Build community through shared discovery
4. Progress from simple constraint intersection to complex key-based interpretation

**NOT "lost language"** - this is discovery, not archaeology. We're scrying the structure of meaning itself.

## Detailed Puzzle Specifications

### Puzzle 1: The First Word

**Discovery Vector:**
- Cryptic tweet: "sol. liq. gas. Three words. Three worlds. One truth between them."
- Tweet includes distorted image with coordinates hidden in metadata

**The Puzzle:**
A single Limn word appears: `cor`

Below it, four images:
1. A human heart
2. The core of an apple
3. The nucleus of an atom
4. A person standing at the center of a crowd

Text: "What binds these? The word contains them all. Find where they intersect."

**Solution:**
Players must recognize that `cor` = core/center/heart/essence/nucleus
The answer is "center" or variations - but the REAL answer is understanding that Limn words define REGIONS, not single meanings.

**What It Teaches:**
- Limn words are constraint regions, not labels
- Meaning exists in the overlap of examples

**Unlock:**
Correct answer reveals Discord invite link (hidden in base64 or steganography)

---

### Puzzle 2: Between

**Discovery Vector:**
Hidden Discord channel unlocked by Puzzle 1 solution

**The Puzzle:**
Channel reveals:
```
sol aqu = ?

The solid. The water. Where do they meet?
Not here. Not there. Between.

Speak the intersection.
```

Accompanied by image: glacier, frozen tear, ice cube, frost on window

**Solution:**
`sol aqu` = solid + water = ice (and related concepts)

Players must provide interpretations showing they understand intersection.

**What It Teaches:**
- Two constraints narrow meaning
- Intersection creates more specific concepts

**Unlock:**
Bot responds with a fragment of the vocabulary list (Domain 1: Matter States)
Reveals location of Puzzle 3 (GitHub repository)

---

### Puzzle 3: Order of Things

**Discovery Vector:**
GitHub repository appears with strange commit history

**The Puzzle:**
Commit messages form a story when read in order:
```
"sol aqu is the first"
"aqu sol is the second"
"they are different... or are they?"
"reverse to find the truth"
```

The code contains tests that seem to check if `sol aqu` equals `aqu sol`

Hidden file `.truth` contains:
```
lif gro you
gro lif you
you gro lif
you lif gro
gro you lif
lif you gro

Six permutations. One meaning.
The order of words matters in English.
The order of words does not matter in ______.
```

**Solution:**
"Limn" (or understanding that word order is irrelevant in Limn)

To prove understanding, players must demonstrate that all permutations mean the same thing: "young/new + alive/living + growth" = seedling, child, new life

**What It Teaches:**
- Commutativity: word order doesn't affect meaning
- All permutations of the same words are equivalent

**Unlock:**
Completing this unlocks Phase 2 - a new Twitter post from the account with coordinates to a hidden website page

---

### Puzzle 4: Not What You Think

**Discovery Vector:**
Hidden page on limn.xyz (or similar) found via Phase 1 completion

**The Puzzle:**
Page displays:
```
nu sol aqu

The prefix inverts. The following word transforms.
NOT-solid + water = ?

But consider:
sol nu aqu

solid + NOT-water = ?

The same words. Different meaning.
The operator binds to what follows.

What is the liquid that flows but is not water?
Express it in Limn.
```

**Solution:**
Players must construct: `liq nu aqu` (liquid + not-water)
OR demonstrate understanding that `nu sol aqu` = liquid water, steam
while `sol nu aqu` = dry solid (stone, bone)

**What It Teaches:**
- The `nu` negation operator
- Operator scope: binds to immediately following word
- Negation + intersection creates complement regions

**Unlock:**
Reveals a cipher key fragment (1/4) needed for Puzzle 10
Also grants access to expanded vocabulary list

---

### Puzzle 5: The Boundary

**Discovery Vector:**
Twitter/X thread that appears as seemingly random Limn words

**The Puzzle:**
Thread reads:
```
Post 1: "bri beg | dim end"
Post 2: "Two thoughts. One moment. Between them, the boundary."
Post 3: "yo joy | an sad"
Post 4: "Here and there. This and that. The line between."
Post 5: "Without the boundary: bridbegdimend - chaos"
Post 6: "With the boundary: meaning separates, then relates"
Post 7: "Speak two truths, divided but connected: _______ | _______"
```

**Solution:**
Players must create their own `X | Y` construction showing two related but separate concepts.

Examples that would be accepted:
- `lif bir | dea end` (life beginning | death ending)
- `hot pyr | col aqu` (hot fire | cold water)
- `old pas | you fut` (old past | young future)

**What It Teaches:**
- The `|` scope boundary operator
- How to express parallel or contrasting concepts
- Relationship between separated scopes

**Unlock:**
Correct submissions earn a Discord role ("Boundary Walker") granting access to advanced channels
Reveals cipher key fragment 2/4

---

### Puzzle 6: Deeper

**Discovery Vector:**
Audio file hidden in website (spectrogram contains message pointing to file)

**The Puzzle:**
Audio contains synthesized voice reading:
```
"nu sol aqu means not-solid and water.
nu (sol aqu) means not solid-water.
The parentheses group. The grouped is negated whole.

Listen:
nu lif gro = (not alive) and growing = cancer, virus, machine
nu (lif gro) = not (alive and growing) = dead, or alive-not-growing, or unliving

The parentheses change everything.

What is: nu (bri hop) ?
What is: nu bri hop ?

Show me the difference."
```

**Solution:**
- `nu (bri hop)` = NOT (bright + hope) = darkness OR despair OR anything that's not hopeful brightness = despair, cynicism, dark pessimism
- `nu bri hop` = (NOT bright) + hope = dim hope, faint hope, hidden hope, hope in darkness

Players must demonstrate understanding of both readings.

**What It Teaches:**
- Parenthetical grouping
- How grouping affects negation scope
- The compositionality of Limn grammar

**Unlock:**
Reveals a lore document about "The First Limnographers"
Grants cipher key fragment 3/4

### Puzzle 7: One Sentence, Many Truths

**Discovery Vector:**
Discord community event - all participants get the same sentence

**The Puzzle:**
Announcement:
```
THE SEVENTH TRIAL

A sentence will be revealed. Each solver provides one interpretation.
No two solvers may provide the same interpretation.
When 100 unique interpretations are collected, the gate opens.

The sentence:
lif gro mov tra

Constraints: alive, growth, movement, transformation

Speak your truth. It is one of many.
```

**Solution:**
This is a COMMUNITY puzzle. Players must collaboratively generate 100+ unique interpretations.

Examples:
- Evolution of species (biology key)
- Child learning to walk (development key)
- Social movement gaining power (politics key)
- Viral spread of ideas (memetics key)
- Forest fire spreading (ecology key)
- Startup scaling (business key)
- Spiritual awakening spreading (religion key)
- etc.

**What It Teaches:**
- Ambiguity is a FEATURE, not a bug
- The same sentence has many valid readings
- Context/key selects among readings
- Community can explore meaning-space together

**Unlock:**
When 100 interpretations are collected:
- A compilation document is created
- All participants receive "Meaning Seeker" role
- Puzzle 8 location revealed

### Puzzle 8: The Key

**Discovery Vector:**
Website + Twitter working together

**The Puzzle:**
Website displays a Limn sentence:
```
hot col bet mov tra

Five constraints. Infinite readings. One truth.
```

Twitter posts provide "keys" over time (one per day for a week):
```
Day 1: Key = "weather"
Day 2: Key = "emotion"
Day 3: Key = "cooking"
Day 4: Key = "metallurgy"
Day 5: Key = "philosophy"
Day 6: Key = "relationships"
Day 7: Key = "________" (players provide this)
```

**Solution:**
For each key, players must provide the collapsed interpretation:

- Weather: Storm front, temperature changes
- Emotion: Passion cooling, mood swings, emotional processing
- Cooking: Tempering, temperature control, perfect heat
- Metallurgy: Forging, annealing, heat treatment
- Philosophy: Dialectic, thesis-antithesis-synthesis
- Relationships: Hot-cold dynamics, emotional processing
- Player key: They must invent a domain and show the collapse

**What It Teaches:**
- Keys disambiguate
- The same sentence reads differently under different contexts
- Precision emerges from constraint + key

**Unlock:**
Reveals a lore chapter: "The Nature of Meaning"
Cipher key fragment 4/4

### Puzzle 9: Self-Reference

**Discovery Vector:**
GitHub README that contains encoded Limn

**The Puzzle:**
README contains what appears to be project documentation, but hidden within is:
```
## About This Project

yo wor | an wor | mea bet

This project is about *that which speaks about itself*.

wor mea amb | def cle kno

Without context, all is possible.
With context, one is actual.

## The Final Question

Write a Limn sentence ABOUT Limn.
Use only Limn words.
Describe what we have been learning.

Your sentence must be:
- At least 5 words
- Contain at least one operator
- Be self-referential (about language/meaning)

Post your sentence. Explain it in English.
If you have understood, the final door opens.
```

**Solution:**
Players must create self-referential Limn sentences.

Examples:
- `wor man joi | mea one eme` (many words joining | one meaning emerges)
- `amb nu def | cle kno thu` (ambiguity + not definition | clear knowing therefore)
- `yo mea | sa an mea | dif sam` (this meaning | same that meaning | different same)

**What It Teaches:**
- Limn can describe itself (metacircular)
- The language has philosophical depth
- Self-reference is possible and meaningful

**Unlock:**
Access to Puzzle 10
Recognition as "Limnographer Initiate"

## Lore Fragments (Revealed Through Puzzles)

### Fragment 1 (After Puzzle 2):
*"Before there were words that pointed, there were words that contained. The Limnographers understood: a word is not an arrow. It is a circle."*

### Fragment 2 (After Puzzle 4):
*"They spoke in regions, not labels. When they said 'sol,' they meant everything the solid touches - rock and bone and ice and certainty. The intersection was their grammar."*

### Fragment 3 (After Puzzle 6 - Full Document):
**"The First Limnographers"**

*In the beginning, language was force. Words struck like hammers. "This IS that." No room for maybe. No space for almost.*

*The Limnographers sought another way. What if words did not point, but encompassed? What if meaning was not assigned, but discovered? What if the truth lived not in the word, but in the space between words?*

*They built a language of intersections. Each word a region. Each sentence a narrowing. Each conversation a dance of constraint and possibility.*

*The language was lost. Or perhaps it was never lost - only waiting. Waiting for minds that could think in regions. Waiting for those who understood that ambiguity is not failure, but invitation.*

*You have found the fragments. You are learning the grammar. Soon you will speak in intersections.*

*Soon you will be Limnographers.*

### Fragment 4 (After Puzzle 8 - Full Chapter):
**"The Nature of Meaning"**

*Meaning does not live in words. Meaning lives in the intersection of words and context. The Limnographers called this intersection "the center that moves."*

*A word alone is vast - containing multitudes, admitting everything that might be. Two words narrow the field. Three narrow further. But the narrowing is not enough. Without a key, the sentence remains pregnant with possibility.*

*The key is not a word. The key is a world. The shared context between speaker and listener. The moment, the memory, the matter at hand.*

*When key meets sentence, ambiguity collapses. One meaning emerges from many. This is not reduction - it is crystallization. The other meanings do not disappear. They wait, dormant, for a different key to call them forth.*

*This is why Limn can be poetry and precision both. The same sentence, transformed by its frame.*
