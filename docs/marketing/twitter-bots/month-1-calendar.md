**If engagement underwhelms:**
- Reduce to 1-2 posts per bot per day
- Increase conversation ratio
- Add more provocative/quotable content

**If controversy emerges:**
- Do not break character to defend
- Use in-character responses
- Let @limn_void absorb criticism (that's their role)

**If journalists/researchers contact:**
- Respond professionally via DM
- Provide background documentation
- Maintain some mystery even in explanations
