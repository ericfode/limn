# Puzzle 02: Between

**Phase:** Discovery
**Difficulty:** 2/10
**Concept:** Two-word constraint intersection

---

## What The Player Sees

### Discovery Vector

After solving Puzzle 01 and joining the Discord server, players are directed to a hidden channel called `#puzzle-02-chamber`.

The channel appears locked at first. A bot message reads:
```
This chamber requires the first truth.

What does a word contain?
```

When a player responds with anything demonstrating understanding of constraint regions (e.g., "multiple meanings," "a region of meaning," "many things, not one"), the channel unlocks and reveals:

### The Main Puzzle

**Channel description:** "Where two circles overlap, meaning sharpens."

**Pinned message:**
```
sol aqu = ?

[IMAGE: Four photographs arranged horizontally]

The solid. The water. Not one. Not the other. Between.

Where do they meet? Speak the intersection.

Reply with your understanding. The region, not the word.
```

**The Images:**
1. A glacier calving into the sea
2. A frozen tear on a cold cheek
3. Ice cubes in a glass
4. Morning frost crystallizing on a window

All images share an aesthetic: blue-white tones, cold, crystalline.

### Additional Channel Content

After the main puzzle, a second pinned message:
```
Remember:
sol = solid, rigid, hard, frozen, fixed, bone, rock, ice, certainty, stability
aqu = water, liquid flow, ocean, rain, tear, blood, life-fluid, emotion

Where sol meets aqu, what remains?
```

## The Puzzle Mechanism

Players must understand that combining two Limn words NARROWS meaning through intersection.

`sol` alone = vast region (everything solid)
`aqu` alone = vast region (everything water-related)
`sol aqu` = only things that are BOTH solid AND water-related

The intersection includes:
- Ice (frozen water)
- Glacier
- Frost
- Hail
- Frozen tears
- Icicles
- Permafrost
- Snow (debatable - is it solid?)

Players must articulate this intersection, not just name one example.

---

## Valid Solutions

### Tier 1 (Single Example):
- "ice"
- "glacier"
- "frost"
- "frozen water"

*Response:*
```
Ice is one truth. But `sol aqu` contains more than ice.

What else lives in the intersection?
Name three. Explain why each belongs.
```

### Tier 2 (Multiple Examples):
- "ice, glacier, frost, hail"
- "frozen water in various forms"
- "things that are solid water"

*Response:*
```
You see the intersection. Now speak the principle.

`sol aqu` = solid AND water-related

What does "AND" do to meaning?
```

### Tier 3 (Full Understanding):
Any response that demonstrates understanding of constraint intersection:
- "sol aqu means the intersection of solid and water - anything that is both"
- "the two constraints narrow each other - only solid water things remain"
- "ice, glacier, frost, hail - anything that fits both constraints"
- "combining words narrows meaning to what fits all constraints"

*Response:*
```
You have learned the second truth:

Words combine by intersection.
Two regions overlap.
Meaning sharpens.

sol aqu = ice, glacier, frost, hail, frozen tear, icicle...
All solid. All water. Both, not either.

This is the grammar of Limn.

## What This Teaches

**Primary Concept:** Constraint intersection - combining Limn words narrows meaning to the overlap.

**Secondary Concepts:**
- Two words together are more specific than either alone
- The intersection might still contain multiple valid referents
- "AND" logic, not "OR" logic

**Grammar Foundation:**
This is the fundamental grammar rule of Limn: adjacent words combine by intersection.

## Distribution Details

### Platform: Discord (Hidden Channel)

**Channel Setup:**
- Name: `#puzzle-02-chamber`
- Locked by default
- Unlocks when player demonstrates Puzzle 01 understanding in `#arrival`

**Bot Behavior:**
- Monitors for responses to the puzzle
- Evaluates understanding tier
- Provides appropriate feedback
- Tracks who has solved

**Atmosphere:**
- Sparse messages (mysterious)
- Other solvers' discussions visible (but not their solutions)
- Channel has custom emoji for Limn words

### Image Assets

Four photographs with consistent aesthetic:
1. **Glacier** - massive, ancient, blue-white
2. **Frozen tear** - intimate, emotional, crystalline
3. **Ice cubes** - domestic, everyday, clear
4. **Frost on window** - delicate, pattern-forming, ephemeral

Style: Slightly desaturated, blue-shifted, high contrast. Should feel cold and mysterious.

## Unlock Mechanism

### What Players Receive:

**Tier 1-2:**
Continued guidance toward full understanding.

**Tier 3 (Full Solve):**

1. **Vocabulary Fragment** - Domain 1: Matter States
   ```
   FRAGMENT UNLOCKED: Domain 1 - Matter States

   sol = solid, rigid
   liq = liquid, flowing
   gas = gaseous, diffuse
   gel = semi-solid, viscous
   pow = powder, granular
   fib = fibrous, stringy
   cry = crystalline
   org = organic matter
   met = metallic

   These are regions, not definitions.
   sol contains rock, bone, ice, certainty.
   Each word is a circle. Sentences are intersections.
   ```

2. **Puzzle 03 Coordinates**
   ```
   The third truth awaits.

   Look here: github.com/[ACCOUNT]/limn-fragments

   The order of things matters... or does it?
   ```

3. **Discord Role:** "Intersection Seeker"
   - Grants access to `#puzzle-02-alumni`
   - Can see (but not post in) `#puzzle-03-preparation`

## Hints (If Needed)

**Hint 1** (After 24 hours of attempts):
Bot posts to channel:
```
Consider:
sol alone = mountain, bone, steel, ice, certainty, foundation...
aqu alone = river, blood, tear, ocean, rain, emotion...

What appears in BOTH lists?
```

**Hint 2** (After 48 hours):
```
In Limn, words do not add. Words intersect.

sol + aqu ≠ solid OR water
sol + aqu = solid AND water

What is solid AND water?
```

**Hint 3** (Only if truly stuck):
```
sol aqu = frozen water, in all its forms.

Ice is one. Glacier is another. Frost is a third.
The intersection contains all of them.

Now: WHY does sol aqu mean this?
What does combining two words DO in Limn?
```

---

## Extended Challenge (Optional)

For players who solve quickly, an additional challenge appears:

```
BONUS CHALLENGE

You have understood sol aqu.

Now consider:
liq pyr = ?

liquid + fire-related = ?

What is the intersection? The region, not one word.
```

**Valid answers:**
- lava, molten metal, molten glass
- "anything that is liquid and fire/heat-related"
- plasma (boundary case - acceptable)

This reinforces the concept and previews more vocabulary.

## Design Notes

### Why This Works:
1. **Builds on Puzzle 01:** Same conceptual framework (regions)
2. **New mechanic:** Intersection of two regions
3. **Visual support:** Images make the concept tangible
4. **Clear success criteria:** Can articulate the intersection principle

### Connection to Limn:
This puzzle teaches the CORE grammar rule: adjacent words combine by intersection. Everything else in Limn builds on this.

### Potential Issues:
- Players might just say "ice" and think they're done
  - *Mitigation:* Tiered response system pushes toward deeper understanding
- The "AND" logic might be confused with "OR"
  - *Mitigation:* Hint 2 explicitly addresses this
- Discord channel might get cluttered with discussion
  - *Mitigation:* Separate discussion channel from solve channel

### Success Criteria:
- 70% of Puzzle 01 solvers attempt this
- 50% reach Tier 3 understanding
- Average solve time: 30-60 minutes
- Zero frustration quit (always possible to progress with hints)

## Narrative Thread

### Before Puzzle:
Players know words are regions.

### After Puzzle:
Players know sentences combine regions through intersection.

### Lore Connection:
The frozen images connect to a theme: meaning is crystallized when constraints combine. Like water becoming ice, vague meaning becomes sharp when constrained.

Optional lore reveal for top solvers:
```
FRAGMENT: The Second Limnographer

"They asked me what I meant by 'sol aqu.'
I showed them ice. They nodded.
I showed them glacier. They nodded.
I showed them the frozen moment before tears fall.
They stopped nodding. They began to see.

'Sol aqu' is not ice. It is not glacier.
It is the region where solid meets water.
It is every frozen thing, and things not yet frozen,
and things that could freeze, and things remembered as frozen.

The word does not end at its border.
The word ends where another word begins.
Between them, meaning lives."

- Fragment from "The Journals of K_____"
```

## Technical Implementation

### Bot Logic (Pseudocode):

```python
TIER_1_ANSWERS = ["ice", "glacier", "frost", "frozen", "hail", "snow", "icicle"]
TIER_2_INDICATORS = ["multiple", "various", "forms", "different", "all", "both"]
TIER_3_PHRASES = ["intersection", "and", "both constraints", "overlap",
                   "narrow", "combines", "where.*meet"]

def evaluate_puzzle_02(response):
    response_lower = response.lower()

    # Check Tier 3 first
    tier_3_match = any(re.search(phrase, response_lower) for phrase in TIER_3_PHRASES)
    has_examples = any(ans in response_lower for ans in TIER_1_ANSWERS)

    if tier_3_match and has_examples:
        return "TIER_3"

    # Check Tier 2
    tier_2_match = any(ind in response_lower for ind in TIER_2_INDICATORS)
    example_count = sum(1 for ans in TIER_1_ANSWERS if ans in response_lower)

    if tier_2_match or example_count >= 2:
        return "TIER_2"

    # Check Tier 1
    if example_count >= 1:
        return "TIER_1"

    return "INCORRECT"
```
