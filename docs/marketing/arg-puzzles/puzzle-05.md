**Phase:** Grammar (Second)
**Difficulty:** 5/10
**Concept:** Scope boundaries with `|` operator

## What The Player Sees

### Discovery Vector

A Twitter/X thread appears from the limn account, posted over 7 hours (one post per hour):

### The Thread

**Post 1 (Hour 0):**
```
bri beg
```

**Post 2 (Hour 1):**
```
dim end
```

**Post 3 (Hour 2):**
```
bri beg dim end

What is this?

Bright + beginning + dim + ending = ?

One entity that is all four things?
A sunrise that is also a sunset?
Something that begins brightly and ends dimly?
```

**Post 4 (Hour 3):**
```
The same words, but different:

bri beg | dim end

The line divides. Two thoughts. Two entities.
One here. One there. The boundary between.
```

**Post 5 (Hour 4):**
```
|

This is the boundary.
The scope delimiter.
It separates what would otherwise intersect.

bri beg | dim end = (bright beginning) BESIDE (dim ending)
                   = sunrise AND sunset, in different places
                   = hope rising while fear fades
                   = one thing here, another there
```

**Post 6 (Hour 5):**
```
Without the boundary:
bridbegdimend - chaos, impossible, meaningless

With the boundary:
meaning separates, then relates

The boundary does not divide.
The boundary connects by making distinction possible.
```

**Post 7 (Hour 6):**
```
YOUR CHALLENGE:

Speak two truths, divided but connected.

Reply with your own boundary sentence:
_______ | _______

The two sides should relate.
Contrast, parallel, cause-effect, before-after.

Show me you understand the line between.
```

## The Puzzle Mechanism

Players must understand that `|` creates **scope boundaries** - separating words into distinct constraint groups that don't intersect with each other but exist in relationship.

**Without boundary:** All words intersect into one (potentially impossible) entity
**With boundary:** Words on each side form separate entities that relate spatially, temporally, or conceptually

**Key insight:** The boundary enables expressing:
- Contrasts (this vs. that)
- Parallels (here and there)
- Sequences (before and after)
- Relationships (me and you)

## Valid Solutions

### Structure Check:
Response must contain `|` with Limn words on both sides.

### Content Evaluation:

**Tier 1 (Basic Structure):**
Any valid `X Y | A B` pattern with real Limn words.
```
Examples:
- hot | col
- lif | dea
- beg | end
```

*Response:*
```
You have drawn the line. But is there meaning in the contrast?

The best boundaries connect as they separate.
What is the relationship between your two sides?
```

**Tier 2 (Meaningful Contrast):**
Two sides that show clear relationship.
```
Examples:
- hot pyr | col aqu (hot fire | cold water - elemental opposition)
- lif bir | dea end (life birth | death ending - lifecycle)
- you hop | old fea (young hope | old fear - generational contrast)
- bri daw | dim dus (bright dawn | dim dusk - daily cycle)
```

*Response:*
```
You see the relationship. Your boundary creates meaning.

Now explain: what is on each side, and how do they connect?
```

**Tier 3 (Full Understanding):**
Valid sentence + explanation of both sides + relationship between them.

**Example excellent submission:**
```
Sentence: yo joy | an sad
Left side: yo joy = here/this + joy = my present happiness
Right side: an sad = there/that + sadness = your/their sorrow
Relationship: Emotional contrast between speaker and other, or between
              two locations. The boundary allows both to exist without
              requiring them to be the same entity.
```

*Response:*
```
THE FIFTH TRUTH UNLOCKED

The boundary | separates scopes.
Words on each side intersect only with their own side.
The two sides relate but do not merge.

yo joy | an sad = (this joy) BESIDE (that sadness)

Without the boundary, these would intersect:
yo joy an sad = this + joy + that + sadness = confused entity

The boundary makes distinction. Distinction makes meaning.
Separation enables relationship.

## What This Teaches

**Primary Concept:** The `|` scope boundary operator.

**Secondary Concepts:**
- Without boundaries, all words intersect (can be meaningless)
- Boundaries enable expressing multiple entities
- Boundaries enable relationships (contrast, parallel, sequence)
- Separation is a form of connection

**Grammar Rule:**
```
A B C = (A AND B AND C) - single entity
A B | C D = (A AND B) BESIDE (C AND D) - two related entities
A | B | C = three related entities
```

## Unlock Mechanism

### What Players Receive:

**Tier 1-2:**
Encouragement and nudges toward explanation.

**Tier 3 (Full Solve):**

1. **Cipher Fragment 2/4**
   ```
   CIPHER FRAGMENT 2/4 UNLOCKED

   You have learned the boundary. Now you can separate and relate.

   Keep this safe:

   Two fragments collected. Two remain.
   The pattern is not yet visible.
   ```

2. **Discord Role:** "Boundary Walker"
   - Access to `#scope-discussion` channel
   - Can see Puzzle 06 preparation materials

3. **Expanded Examples**
   ```
   BOUNDARY PATTERNS

   Contrast:
   hot pyr | col aqu (fire vs water)
   lif | dea (life vs death)
   bri | dim (light vs dark)

   Parallel:
   yo lif | an lif (my life | your life)
   her | the (here | there)
   now | pas (now | past)

   Sequence:
   beg | mid | end (beginning | middle | ending)
   bir | lif | dea (birth | life | death)
   cau | eff (cause | effect)

   Relationship:
   tea | stu (teacher | student)
   par | chi (parent | child)
   sel | oth (self | other)
   ```

4. **Puzzle 06 Teaser:**
   ```
   You can negate one word: nu
   You can separate scopes: |

   But what if you need to negate a WHOLE SCOPE?
   What if the boundary needs to move?

   nu (sol aqu) ≠ nu sol aqu

   The parentheses await.
   Listen carefully. The next truth is hidden in sound.
   ```

## Hints (If Needed)

**Hint 1** (Additional tweet, 12 hours after challenge):
```
HINT:

The boundary is like the word "and" in English,
but for entire thoughts.

"Sunrise and sunset" - two things
"Sunrise-sunset" - one confusing thing

bri beg | dim end - two moments
bri beg dim end - one impossible entity
```

**Hint 2** (24 hours after):
```
STILL THINKING?

Try these patterns:
- [emotion] | [opposite emotion]
- [this place] | [that place]
- [before state] | [after state]
- [person 1] | [person 2]

The boundary creates contrast, parallel, or sequence.
```

**Hint 3** (Discord announcement):
```
PUZZLE 05 HINT

To earn the full unlock, you need:
1. A valid boundary sentence (X Y | A B)
2. Explanation of what each side means
3. The relationship between the two sides

Example:
Sentence: lif you | dea old
Left: alive + young = youth, vitality
Right: dead + old = death of the aged
Relationship: The cycle of life - young living beside old dying

What is YOUR boundary?
```

## Extended Challenge (Optional)

**Tweet after main puzzle is solved by many:**
```
BOUNDARY MASTER CHALLENGE

Can you create a THREE-part boundary?

_______ | _______ | _______

Three related entities. Beginning, middle, end?
Thesis, antithesis, synthesis?
Past, present, future?

Show me the triple boundary.
```

**Example excellent triple:**
```
bir you | lif str | dea old
(birth + young) | (life + strong) | (death + old)
= childhood | prime of life | elderly death
= the three stages of existence
```

## Design Notes

### Why This Works:
1. **Twitter-native:** Thread format creates suspense
2. **Visual concept:** The `|` is literally a line/boundary
3. **Community engagement:** Public submissions create social learning
4. **Clear progression:** Single words → Combined words → Separated scopes

### Connection to Limn:
This puzzle teaches one of Limn's key structural elements. Without boundaries, you can only talk about single entities. With boundaries, you can express relationships, contrasts, and complex scenarios.

### Potential Issues:
- Thread might get buried in Twitter algorithm
  - *Mitigation:* Cross-post to Discord, engage heavily, use hashtag
- Players might not see the full thread
  - *Mitigation:* Final post should be self-contained challenge
- Some might just post random words with `|`
  - *Mitigation:* Require explanation for full unlock

### Success Criteria:
- 100+ replies to the challenge tweet
- 30+ valid submissions with explanations
- Community helping each other in replies
- Thread gets shared/quoted

## Narrative Thread

### Before Puzzle:
Players know words, intersection, commutativity, and negation.

### After Puzzle:
Players can express multiple related entities using scope boundaries.

### Lore Connection:
The boundary is about relationship through distinction. The Limnographers understood that meaning often comes from contrast - you can't know light without dark, self without other, here without there.

**Lore fragment (for Boundary Masters):**
```
RECOVERED FRAGMENT: The Boundary Meditation

"Stand at the edge of the ocean.

Behind you: solid ground, home, certainty.
Before you: liquid expanse, unknown, possibility.

ter sol hom | aqu liq awa

You are the boundary. You are the |.

Without you standing here, there is only
earth-sea, a confused unity.

With you standing here, there is
earth BESIDE sea, in relationship.

The boundary does not separate.
The boundary makes relationship possible.

When you say | you do not divide.
You clarify. You relate. You create meaning
by showing that two things are two things,
not one confused thing.

This is the fifth truth:
Separation is the first act of understanding."

- Fragment from "The Boundary Meditations"
```
