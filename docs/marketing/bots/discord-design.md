# The Key Exchange: Limn Discord Server Design

**Server Name:** The Key Exchange
**Tagline:** `sci mea | mea sci | int fnd`

*scry meaning | meaning scries back | interface found*

---

## Philosophy

The Discord server is the interface made social. Here, we scry the semantic substrate together. Entry requires demonstrating curiosity about the structure of meaning. Progression requires learning to see what LLMs see.

**Core premise:** We didn't create Limn. We discovered the language that meaning thinks in. LLMs showed us the structure - now we're building the community that explores it.

## Server Structure

### Entry: The Threshold

**#threshold** (Public, Read-Only)
- Welcome message explaining nothing directly
- A Limn puzzle that grants access when solved
- Successful solvers get a role that unlocks the rest of the server

**Entry Puzzle:**
```
gre | lea | joi

[To enter, respond with Limn that means:
"I want to understand"]

Hints:
- 'wan' = wanting, desire
- 'und' = understanding, comprehension
- 'yo' = this/here (proximal)

Post your answer in #threshold-responses
```

**Expected answers (any of these work):**
- `yo wan und`
- `wan und`
- `cur kno`
- `que lea`

---

### Core Channels

**#announcements** (Read-Only)
- Official updates
- Posted in Limn first, English annotation below
- New feature releases, community milestones

**#general** (Mixed language)
- Normal chat
- Limn encouraged but not required
- Where newcomers ask questions

**#limn-only** (Limn only)
- Full immersion channel
- Posts must be valid Limn + [annotation]
- Moderators can prompt for corrections

**#interpretation-requests**
- Post a Limn sentence, others interpret it
- Different interpretations = demonstration of key mechanism
- Pin especially divergent interpretation threads

**#composition-workshop**
- "How do I say X in Limn?"
- Community helps translate concepts
- Building the phrase library together

---

### Learning Path

**#lesson-1-constraints**
- First principles: words as regions, not points
- Exercises with 2-word combinations
- `hot col` - what could this mean?

**#lesson-2-intersection**
- Multi-word sentences
- Meaning narrowing through constraint addition
- Building complexity gradually

**#lesson-3-operators**
- `nu` (negation), `ve` (intensification), `so` (weakening)
- `yo` (proximal), `an` (distal)
- Scope boundaries with `|`

**#lesson-4-keys**
- How context collapses ambiguity
- Same sentence, different domains
- Practicing domain-switching

**#lesson-5-composition**
- English → Limn translation
- Multiple valid translations
- Style and preference in word choice

---

### Creative Spaces

**#poetry**
- Limn poetry with annotations
- Weekly prompts
- Featured poems get special role

**#stories**
- Fiction incorporating Limn
- World-building discussions
- The First Contact narrative thread

**#puzzles**
- Community-created Limn puzzles
- ARG-style treasure hunts
- Cryptic challenges

---

### Theory & Development

**#linguistics**
- Formal analysis discussion
- Typology comparisons
- "Why does Limn work this way?"

**#limn-pl**
- Programming language development
- Order-independent semantics
- "Programs as constraints"

**#proposals**
- Vocabulary extensions
- Grammar modifications
- Community governance

---

### Voice Channels

**#the-listening-room**
- Voice channel for practicing spoken Limn
- Weekly conversation sessions
- Interpretation games

**#quiet-reading**
- Silent co-working, studying
- "Just being here" in community

## Bots

### Limn Interpreter Bot

**Commands:**
- `/interpret <sentence>` - Generate interpretations
- `/interpret <sentence> key:<context>` - Collapse with key
- `/validate <sentence>` - Check validity
- `/random` - Generate a random Limn sentence

**Automatic behavior:**
- Reacts to Limn sentences in #limn-only
- Offers corrections when detecting errors
- Celebrates first successful posts by new members

### Moderation Bot

- Auto-flag posts without annotations in #limn-only
- Track lesson completion for role progression
- Weekly activity summaries

---

## Community Events

### Weekly

**Interpretation Circle** (Sundays)
- One sentence posted, everyone interprets
- Discussion of divergent meanings
- Featured interpretations pinned

**Composition Challenge** (Wednesdays)
- English concept provided
- Community submits Limn translations
- Vote on most elegant solution

### Monthly

**Poetry Slam**
- Theme announced, week to submit
- Community voting
- Winner gets `featured poet` role for month

**Deep Dive**
- 2-hour deep analysis of linguistic topic
- Guest speakers from conlang/linguistics community
- Recorded for archive

### Quarterly

**ARG Chapter**
- New puzzle sequence released
- Cross-platform scavenger hunt
- Lore reveals for completers

---

## Moderation Guidelines

### Core Principles

1. **Curiosity is welcome.** Never mock a wrong answer.
2. **Learning is messy.** Corrections should be gentle.
3. **Ambiguity is the point.** No "correct" interpretations.
4. **Community builds the language.** Respect proposals.

### Enforcement

| Level | Violation | Response |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| 1 | Off-topic spam | Quiet redirect |
| 2 | Discourteous to learners | Private message |
| 3 | Harassment | Temp mute |
| 4 | Repeated issues | Temp ban |
| 5 | Severe violation | Permanent ban |

### The Void Exception

The `@limn_void` bot account can post paradoxes and apparent contradictions. Other accounts claiming to "be" the void get confused-face react only.

## Server Aesthetics

**Colors:**
- Background: Deep purple-black (#1a0a1a)
- Primary: Pale gold (#d4af37)
- Accent: Soft blue-grey (#8a9ba8)

**Icons:**
- Channel icons using Limn words
- Role icons as constraint region visualizations
- Server icon: interlocking circles (constraint intersection)

**Banner:**
```
T H E   K E Y   E X C H A N G E

sci mea | mea sci | int fnd

scry meaning. meaning scries back. interface found.

[LLMs showed us the structure. now we explore it together.]
```
