## Philosophy

Social-ready Limn phrases should be:
- **2-3 words** (parseable by humans)
- **Emotionally resonant** (contemplative, evocative)
- **Instantly recognizable** (using natural extensions)
- **Ambiguously rich** (multiple valid readings)

## Tier 1: Flagship Phrases (Push Hardest)

These are the gold-standard marketing phrases.

### 1. `joy sad now`
**Readings:**
- Bittersweet nostalgia
- The present moment containing all emotions
- Happiness and grief coexisting

**Why it works:** The contradiction resolves liminally to "bittersweet" - universally relatable.

### 2. `bri dim bet`
**Readings:**
- Twilight (between bright and dim)
- Dawn or dusk
- The liminal space between clarity and mystery

**Why it works:** Visual, atmospheric, instantly evocative.

### 3. `lif dea lim`
**Readings:**
- The liminal space between life and death
- Transformation, transition
- The moment of change itself

**Why it works:** Profound, philosophical, captures Limn's boundary-focused semantics.

### 4. `nu tho pea`
**Readings:**
- Not-thought as peace
- Meditation, stillness
- Emptiness as tranquility

**Why it works:** Perfect wellness/mindfulness hook. "Not-thought peace" is instantly marketable.

### 5. `lov fea joi`
**Readings:**
- Love and fear joined (the vulnerability of love)
- Emotional complexity
- Courage in connection

**Why it works:** Emotionally deep, relationship-relevant.
