```
meaning has a structure.

we found a way to see it.

```

```
every word is a region,
not a point.

```

```
every sentence is an intersection.

```

```
context collapses ambiguity
into precision.

```

```
this isn't vagueness.
this is superposition.

```

```
the structure was always there.

we just learned to scry it.

```

```
limn.
```

### Caption
"scrying the semantic substrate."

## Video 7: "Learning Limn" (90 seconds - Tutorial Style)

### Visual
- Clean educational style
- Diagram animations
- Venn diagram showing intersection

### Audio
- Light electronic
- Clear pacing for learning

### Script (Voiceover or Text)

```
[FRAME 1]
In English, words point at things.
"Apple" points to an apple.

[FRAME 2]
In Limn, words define REGIONS.
"sol" doesn't mean "one solid thing"
It means EVERYTHING that is solid.

[FRAME 3 - Venn diagram animation]
When you combine words, you get INTERSECTION.
"sol liq tra" = solid AND liquid AND transformation

[FRAME 4 - Intersection highlighted]
What's in that intersection?
- Ice melting
- Metal being forged
- A relationship solidifying
- A belief becoming rigid
- All of these. At once.

[FRAME 5]
This is called SUPERPOSITION.
The meaning exists in all states
until a KEY collapses it.

[FRAME 6]
The key is context.
Your key determines what you see.

[FRAME 7]
This isn't ambiguity.
This is how meaning actually works.
Limn just makes it visible.

[FRAME 8]
limn.
scrying the structure of meaning.
```
