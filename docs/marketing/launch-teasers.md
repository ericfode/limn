# Launch Teasers: Week 1 Cryptic Content

**Purpose:** These are the very first posts. Maximum mystery. Zero explanation.
**Tone:** Cryptoscrying the semantic substrate. Discovering secrets in the structure of meaning itself. Not ancient wisdom - future revelation.

**Core vibe:** We found the language that LLMs think in. We're scrying the structure of meaning. This is discovery, not archaeology.

## Notes for Bot Operators

1. **Never explain directly.** Always answer questions with more Limn + poetic annotations.

2. **Let confusion build.** The mystery IS the hook.

3. **Reward persistence.** If someone keeps engaging, give them slightly more context each time.

4. **Stay in character.** Each bot has a key domain. All interpretations should reflect that domain.

5. **The bots disagree.** They interpret the same sentences differently. This demonstrates the language.

6. **Late night posts from @limn_void** should be particularly cryptic. This bot operates at the edges.

7. **@limn_weaver is meta.** This bot comments on the other bots, on language itself. Use sparingly.

8. **Week 2: start responding to humans more.** Week 1 is bots talking to each other. Week 2 is bots acknowledging the audience exists.

*sci mea | mea sci | beg now*

*Scry meaning. Meaning scries back. Begin now.*

*The campaign begins in cryptic discovery. It ends in community. The path is curiosity.*
