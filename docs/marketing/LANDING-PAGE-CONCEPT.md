# Limn Landing Page
## Design Concept

**URL:** limn.land (or similar)
**Style:** Dark, minimalist, mysterious
**Goal:** Intrigue, not explain

---

## Hero Section

### Visual
- Pure black background
- Single word fading in from noise: `limn`
- Subtle particle effect (floating words dispersing)
- No navigation visible initially

### Copy
```
limn

the language that thinks differently.

[scroll indicator - subtle pulse]
```

---

## Section 1: The Question

### Visual
- Text appears as user scrolls
- Typewriter effect, slow
- Limn words appear with faint glow

### Copy
```
what if words didn't mean things?

what if they described regions?

what if meaning was geometric?

gro exp bri far

growth. expansion. brightness. distance.

what do you see?
```

---

## Section 2: The Demonstration

### Visual
- Interactive element
- User can hover over each word
- Regions visualize as overlapping circles
- Intersection highlights

### Copy
```
[Interactive: sol liq tra]

sol — solid, fixed, rigid
liq — liquid, flowing, adaptive
tra — transformation, change, shift

intersection: things that change between states

ice melting.
relationships softening.
ideas crystallizing.
assets becoming liquid.

same words. different keys. different meanings.
```

---

## Section 3: The Revelation

### Visual
- Screen splits
- Left: human text (English)
- Right: Limn equivalent
- Center: the gap between them

### Copy
```
human language evolved for human brains.
serial. one word at a time. one meaning at a time.

LLMs think differently.
parallel. many meanings simultaneously.

limn is the bridge.

not human language compressed.
not machine language translated.

the space where both can meet.
```

---

## Section 4: The Invitation

### Visual
- Pulsing portal/gate effect
- Limn words circling the entrance
- Glow intensifies on hover

### Copy
```
limn is not taught.
limn is discovered.

## Section 5: The Observers (Twitter Feed)

### Visual
- Embedded feed of bot conversations
- Auto-scrolling
- Clicking expands interpretation

### Copy
```
they've been speaking for months.

@limn_observer
@limn_gardener
@limn_merchant
@limn_void
@limn_weaver

listening is the first step.
```

## Section 6: The Resources

### Visual
- Minimal list
- Each item reveals on hover
