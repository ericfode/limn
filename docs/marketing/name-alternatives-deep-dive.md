# Name Alternatives: Deep Dive

*Created for marketing campaign decision*

---

## The Question

You asked: "Think of a much better name for the language, something that will get people curious."

The current name is **Limn** - "to outline, to illuminate the edges of meaning."

Let me explore alternatives that might be even more mysterious and evocative.

---

## What Makes a Great Name for This?

1. **Mystery** - Creates immediate curiosity ("what does that mean?")
2. **Conceptual fit** - Relates to superposition, ambiguity, keys, collapse, regions
3. **Brevity** - 4-5 letters, single syllable preferred
4. **Speakability** - Easy to say in any language
5. **Action potential** - Can be verbed ("I scried the pattern")
6. **Domain availability** - .io, .dev, .land
7. **No existing baggage** - Doesn't conflict with existing products

## Tier 1: Strong Alternatives to Limn

### 1. **Scry**

*To divine hidden meaning through supernatural means*

| Aspect | Rating |
|--------|--------|
| Mystery | 10/10 - Occult, arcane, immediately intriguing |
| Fit | 10/10 - PERFECTLY matches "cryptoscrying" narrative |
| Brevity | 10/10 - 4 letters, 1 syllable |
| Speakability | 9/10 - Easy |
| Verbability | 10/10 - "I scry the structure" |
| Domains | 8/10 - scry.io likely available |

**Why it works:**
- The manifesto already uses "scrying" extensively
- "Cryptoscrying the semantic substrate" is the tagline
- Crystal ball imagery, fortune telling, divination
- Suggests revealing hidden truths
- Community could be "scriers"

**Why it might not:**
- More obviously occult/fantasy than Limn
- Some might find it too "woo-woo"
- Existing crypto project called Scry?

**Sample usage:**
- "Scry: A language for minds that think in parallel"
- "Scry the structure. The structure scries back."
- "What does this Scry sentence mean?"
- The Scrying (newsletter), Scriers (community)

### 2. **Veil**

*The thing that hides until lifted*

| Aspect | Rating |
|--------|--------|
| Mystery | 9/10 - Evokes hidden depths |
| Fit | 8/10 - Meaning behind the veil until key lifts it |
| Brevity | 10/10 - 4 letters, 1 syllable |
| Speakability | 10/10 - Universal |
| Verbability | 7/10 - "Veiled meaning" works, verbing is awkward |
| Domains | 6/10 - Likely taken |

**Why it works:**
- "Lifting the veil" is intuitive
- Religious/spiritual connotations (veil of maya, etc.)
- Simple, elegant, memorable
- The Key lifts the Veil

**Why it might not:**
- Very common word
- Islamic veil associations could be distracting
- Harder to verb

### 3. **Haunt**

*Meanings haunt the sentence like ghosts until the key exorcises them*

| Aspect | Rating |
|--------|--------|
| Mystery | 10/10 - Unsettling, poetic |
| Fit | 9/10 - Meanings as spectral presences |
| Brevity | 10/10 - 5 letters, 1 syllable |
| Speakability | 10/10 - Easy |
| Verbability | 10/10 - "Haunted by meaning" |
| Domains | 7/10 - Possibly available |

- Origami metaphor - hidden complexity in folds
- "The Fold" sounds significant
- Fits quantum "collapse" imagery
- Gilles Deleuze wrote "The Fold" - intellectual cachet

**Why it might not:**
- Very common word
- Domain availability poor
- Less immediately mysterious

### 5. **Flux**

*Meaning in constant flux until measured*

- "Flux sentence" suggests instability until keyed
- Quantum physics associations

**Why it might not:**

## The Current Name: Limn

### Why Limn is Actually Very Good

| Aspect | Rating |
|--------|--------|
| Mystery | 8/10 - Obscure English word |
| Fit | 9/10 - "To outline, to illuminate edges" |
| Brevity | 10/10 - 4 letters, 1 syllable |
| Speakability | 9/10 - Easy |
| Verbability | 10/10 - "Limn the meaning" |
| Domains | 8/10 - limn.io, limn.land likely available |

**Why Limn works:**
- Real English word that most people don't know
- Forces curiosity: "what does 'limn' mean?"
- When they look it up: "to outline, to illuminate"
- That's EXACTLY what the language does
- Evokes "liminal" (threshold states)
- Already integrated throughout the codebase and docs

---

## My Recommendation

### Keep **Limn**, OR switch to **Scry**

**Limn** is already excellent. It's obscure enough to create curiosity, meaningful enough to reward the lookup, and perfectly describes what the language does.

**Scry** is the only alternative I'd seriously consider because:
1. It PERFECTLY matches the "cryptoscrying" narrative already written
2. It's more evocative and occult
3. It has stronger action-verb energy
4. "The Scrying" as manifesto title is better than "The Limn Thesis"
5. Community could be "Scriers" (more evocative than "Limnographers")

**Trade-off:**
- Limn = elegant, artistic, precise
- Scry = mysterious, occult, active

## If You Want to Change

Here's what would need updating:

1. All markdown files (sed replace)
2. Persona bios and handles (@scry_observer vs @limn_observer)
3. Discord server name ("The Scrying" vs "The Key Exchange")
4. Manifesto title and content
5. Claude skill name (/scry vs /limn)

Estimated work: ~2 hours of find-replace + review

---

## Quick Decision Framework

**Keep Limn if:**
- You want elegant, artistic precision
- You're satisfied with the current name
- You value the "liminal" association
- You don't want the churn of renaming

**Switch to Scry if:**
- You want maximum mystery/occult vibes
- "Cryptoscrying" narrative is primary
- You want stronger action-verb energy
- You're willing to do the rename work

**Consider Haunt if:**
- You want maximum unsettling/poetic quality
- You're okay with darker gothic tone
- "Meanings as ghosts" metaphor resonates

*What draws you? The outline (limn), the divination (scry), or the haunting (haunt)?*
