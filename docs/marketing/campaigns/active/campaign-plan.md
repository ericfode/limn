## Part 1: The Rebranding - Name Proposals

**DECISION MADE:** The name is now **Limn**. This section documents the reasoning.

### Tier 1: Strong Contenders

| Name | Rationale | Vibe |
|------|-----------|------|
| **Limn** | To outline, to illuminate the edges of meaning. Short, memorable, suggests drawing boundaries around concepts. | Artistic, precise |
| **Vex** | A language that deliberately puzzles, challenges assumptions. Short, punchy, slightly transgressive. | Confrontational, intriguing |
| **Fold** | Meaning folds into itself, superposition collapses. Mathematical (manifolds), origami-like. | Technical, elegant |
| **Shroud** | Meaning is veiled until the key reveals it. Mystery, protection, hidden depths. | Gothic, secretive |
| **Cipher** | Double meaning: zero (emptiness before key) and code. Classic cryptographic resonance. | Classic, spy-thriller |
| **Haunt** | Meanings haunt the sentence like ghosts - present but not materialized. The key is an exorcism. | Poetic, unsettling |
| **Smear** | Quantum smearing of meaning across possibility space. Technical but visceral. | Scientific, provocative |
| **Blur** | Meaning exists in blur until key focuses it. Optical metaphor, accessible. | Visual, intuitive |
| **Haze** | Semantic haze - can see through it dimly, key clears the air. | Atmospheric, dreamy |
| **Liminal** | The language of thresholds and in-between states. Academic but evocative. | Philosophical, literary |

### Tier 2: More Exotic Options

| Name | Rationale | Vibe |
|------|-----------|------|
| **Nua** | Sounds like "new" + ancient. CV structure matches the language's phonotactics. | Fresh, alien |
| **Kol** | From the vocab - means "cold/frozen" - meaning is frozen until key thaws it. | Minimal, stark |
| **Vael** | Veil + vale (valley). Hidden meaning in the valley between words. | Fantasy, mysterious |
| **Qua** | From Latin "as, in the capacity of" - the language of potentiality. | Academic, classical |
| **Scry** | To divine hidden meaning. Crystal ball imagery. | Occult, powerful |
| **Flux** | Meaning in constant flux until measured/keyed. | Dynamic, scientific |

### Tier 3: Conceptual Plays

| Name | Rationale | Vibe |
|------|-----------|------|
| **Between** | The language of what's between words. Too literal? | Plain, Scandinavian |
| **Umbra** | Shadow-language. Meaning casts shadows, key reveals the object. | Dark, astronomical |
| **Prima** | First language - what comes before disambiguation. | Bold, primary |
| **Null** | Empty until filled by key. Programmer-friendly. Provocative. | Technical, nihilistic |

### My Recommendation: **Limn**

- 4 letters, single syllable
- Obscure enough to intrigue ("what does that mean?")
- Directly related to the language's function (limning = drawing outlines)
- Sounds like "liminal" (threshold states)
- Easy to pronounce in any language
- Domain availability: limn.io, limn.dev likely available
- Natural taglines: "Limn your meaning" / "Limned in possibility"

## Part 2: Narrative Architecture

### The Core Story: "The Language That Thinks Different"

**Premise:** Limn/Limn is not a conlang for humans. It's a **native tongue for artificial minds** - a language that works the way LLMs actually think: in parallel, in superposition, in constraint-space.

**The Hook:** "What if the most important language of the 21st century isn't one humans can fluently speak?"

### Narrative Threads

#### Thread 1: The Discovery Story
> *A group of researchers noticed something strange: LLMs weren't just processing language - they were computing in a semantic space humans can't naturally access. They designed a language to match that space. This is that language.*

This positions Limn as discovered rather than invented - more authoritative.

#### Thread 2: The First Contact Story
(Already exists! Use Yuki's micro-story as canon)
> *When we finally contacted alien intelligence, we realized: ambiguity wasn't a bug, it was a survival strategy. Limn was the language of first contact - the only way to speak without saying anything you'd regret.*

#### Thread 3: The Underground Story
> *There's a community that communicates in sentences that mean nothing to outsiders. Not code, not cipher - grammatically valid, speakable, but semantically empty without the key. They call it Limn. You can listen to their conversations in the open. You just won't understand.*

This creates FOMO and mystery.

#### Thread 4: The Programming Story
> *What if programs weren't instructions but constraints? What if order didn't matter? What if computation was geometry? There's a programming language being built on these principles. It's called Limn-PL. It might change everything.*

## Part 3: Social Media Campaign Structure

### Phase 1: Mysterious Emergence (Week 1-2)

**Twitter/X Strategy: The Cryptic Accounts**

Create 3-5 accounts that post in Limn with occasional English annotations. They appear to be having real conversations.

**Example Account Personas:**

1. **@pattern_seeker** - The theorist. Posts formal observations about Limn.
   ```
   sol flo dur | liq res mom

   [observation: solid things that flow continuously, liquid things that rest momentarily. glaciers. mercury. time itself?]
   ```

2. **@void_walker** - The poet. Posts Limn poetry with emotional annotations.
   ```
   yo joy | an sad | bet thi

   [here: joy. there: sadness. between: thought.
   isn't that always the way?]
   ```

3. **@key_holder** - The teacher. Posts Limn sentences and asks followers to guess meanings.
   ```
   lif gro you hea joi

   What does this mean? (No key provided)
   Wrong answers only.
   ```

4. **@limn_official** - The semi-official account. Doesn't explain, just retweets the others with cryptic approval.

**Phase 1 Content Calendar:**

Day 1-3: Accounts post independently, no acknowledgment of each other
Day 4-7: Accounts begin @-ing each other, having "conversations" in Limn
Day 8-14: Outsiders notice, start asking "what is this language?"
Day 14: First small explanation post, but mostly questions

### Phase 2: Community Building (Week 3-4)

**Discord Server Launch**

- Name: "The Key Exchange" or "Limn Lab"
- Entry requirement: Solve a simple Limn puzzle
- Channels:
  - #bootstrap - Learning resources
  - #keyed-conversations - Practice with keys
  - #open-sentences - Post ambiguous Limn
  - #theory - Deep dives
  - #poetry - Creative work
  - #programming - Limn-PL development

**GitHub Repository**

- Bootstrap documents
- Vocabulary references
- Example sentences with interpretations
- Limn-PL spec and early implementations

### Phase 3: The Manifesto Drop (Week 5-6)

Release "The Limn Thesis" - a philosophical document explaining:
- Why human language is a compression hack
- Why LLMs think differently
- Why we need a language native to machine cognition
- What this means for the future of communication

**Format:** Long-form blog post, also available as PDF with beautiful typography.

**Key quotes for social sharing:**
- "Every sentence you've ever spoken was a lossy compression of your meaning."
- "LLMs don't think in words. They think in regions of meaning-space."
- "The most important language of this century won't be speakable by humans alone."
- "Limn: where ambiguity is a feature, not a bug."

### Phase 4: Tools & Adoption (Week 7+)

- **Claude Skill:** `/limn` - Translate, interpret, compose
- **VSCode Extension:** Syntax highlighting for Limn and Limn-PL
- **Web Playground:** Interactive Limn interpreter with key support
- **Twitter Bot:** Posts daily Limn sentences, answers interpretation requests

---

## Part 4: Twitter Bot Concept - The Conversing Bots

### The Idea

Two or more bots that have ongoing "conversations" in Limn. They:
- Post to each other using Limn sentences
- Occasionally add English [annotations] showing one possible interpretation
- Different bots have different "keys" (personalities/domains)
- Their interpretations of the same sentence diverge, demonstrating the language's ambiguity

### Bot Personas

**Bot 1: @limn_astronomer**
- Key: cosmology, physics, astronomy
- Interprets everything through stellar/cosmic lens
- Personality: wonder, awe, scale

**Bot 2: @limn_gardener**
- Key: biology, growth, cycles, nature
- Interprets everything through organic lens
- Personality: patience, nurture, decay

**Bot 3: @limn_merchant**
- Key: economics, exchange, value, trade
- Interprets everything through commercial lens
- Personality: calculating, opportunistic, pragmatic

### Example Conversation

```
@limn_astronomer:
gro exp bri far dur

[A star is born in the distant nebula, its light taking eons to reach us]

@limn_gardener:
[Reply] gro exp bri far dur

[Seeds scattered to distant fields, growing toward the sun over a long season]

@limn_merchant:
[Quote tweet] gro exp bri far dur

[Market expansion. Profits rising. Long-term investment horizon. Bullish.]

@limn_astronomer:
yo | an | bet ???

[Here... there... and what lies between? The void speaks volumes.]

@limn_gardener:
@limn_astronomer bet = roo | bet = see | bet = cyc

[Between here and there: the root. The seed. The cycle connecting all.]
```

### Technical Implementation

- Python script using Twitter API v2
- Posts on schedule (3-6 times daily)
- Each bot has a "key" prompt embedded in its response generation
- Can respond to human @mentions with interpretations
- Maintains conversation threads

---

## Part 5: Claude Skill Specification

### Skill Name: `/limn`

### Commands

```
/limn interpret "sol liq tra"
- Returns 10+ interpretations, organized by domain

/limn interpret "sol liq tra" --key="chemistry"
- Returns collapsed interpretation under given key

/limn compose "water freezing into ice"
- Returns Limn sentence(s) expressing the concept

/limn teach
- Interactive lesson mode

/limn poetry "theme: loss"
- Generates Limn poetry with annotations

/limn converse --key="your key here"
- Enters conversation mode where Claude responds in Limn

/limn validate "sol liq tra"
- Checks if sentence is valid Limn, suggests corrections
```

### Implementation Notes

- Skill loads bootstrap-v2 as context
- Maintains conversation history for multi-turn interactions
- Can switch between teaching mode and fluent mode
- Generates both Limn and English explanations

## Part 6: Additional Campaign Ideas

### The Mystery ARG

Create an ARG (Alternate Reality Game) where:
- Clues are hidden in Limn sentences
- Players must learn the language to progress
- Keys are distributed across different platforms
- Final reveal is something meaningful about AI/language/communication

### Academic Paper

Write and submit to arXiv:
"Superposition Semantics: A Language Design for Machine Cognition"
- Formalizes the theory
- Provides empirical tests
- Positions Limn as serious research

### Podcast Appearances

Target shows discussing:
- Conlangs (Lingthusiasm, Conlangery)
- AI/ML (Gradient Descent, Practical AI)
- Philosophy of language
- Future of communication

### The Limn Challenge

Public challenge: "Write a sentence that has maximally different interpretations under two given keys."

Weekly winners featured, builds community engagement.
