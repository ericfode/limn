## Notes

1. **Timing is approximate** - shift by 15-30 min to avoid looking robotic
2. **Reply threading is important** - the conversation effect is key
3. **Monitor for human questions** - Day 5+ expect some
4. **Never explain directly** - always respond with more Limn + cryptic annotation
5. **Let the void be weird** - 3:33 AM, 11:11 PM posts are intentional

*wee one | don | wee two | beg*

*Week one done. Week two begins.*
