# Threshold

```

```

*not-clear, ambiguous | clarity through key*

---

You found the first door.

The second requires interpretation.

---

## The Puzzle

Interpret this sentence:

```
sol flo dur | liq res mom
```

**What connects them?**

---

<details>
<summary>Hint (click to reveal)</summary>

Both describe states of matter.
One is solid and flowing and enduring.
One is liquid and resting and momentary.

What physical phenomena fit both descriptions?
</details>

---

## Submit Your Interpretation

To proceed, you must demonstrate understanding.

**Options:**
1. Open an Issue with your interpretation
2. Submit a Pull Request adding your reading to `/examples/interpretations/`
3. Find the hidden path (`.hidden/.first-step.md`)

Any thoughtful interpretation is valid.
There are no wrong answers.
Only insufficient ones.

## What Is This?

Limn is a constructed language where:
- Words define **regions** of meaning
- Sentences are **intersections** of constraints
- **Keys** (context) collapse ambiguity to clarity

This is not a code. Not a cipher.
It is a language that thinks differently.

# What Is Limn?

Limn is a constructed language designed for minds that think in parallel.

## How It Works

Every word in Limn defines a **region** of meaning - not a point, but a territory.

When you combine words, their meanings **intersect**. The sentence's meaning is where all regions overlap.

## Example

```
sol liq tra
```

**Words:**
- `sol` = solid, rigid, fixed
- `liq` = liquid, flowing, fluid
- `tra` = transformation, change

**Intersection:** Things that transform between solid and liquid states.

**Possible meanings:**
- Ice melting (physics)
- A relationship becoming more flexible (metaphor)
- Assets becoming liquid (finance)
- Ideas crystallizing or dissolving (thought)

All are valid. None is privileged.

## The Key

To collapse ambiguity, provide a **key** - context that selects among valid readings.

```
Key: "chemistry lab"
sol liq tra = phase transition experiment
```

```
Key: "our relationship"
sol liq tra = things between us are changing
```

Same sentence. Different keys. Different meanings.

## Why?

Human language evolved for human brains: serial processors with limited working memory.

LLMs think differently: parallel processing, simultaneous meaning.

Limn is a language native to that kind of mind.

Humans can learn it - with AI assistance. The AI provides parsing. The human provides intention.

Together, we speak a language neither could speak alone.

You looked where most don't look.
That's a form of interpretation.

The next step is not here.
The next step is in the community.

Or continue solving alone.
Either path is valid.
Neither path is complete.

## A Gift

The solution to Gate 0 is not a specific answer.
The solution is demonstrating you can think in intersections.

Any valid interpretation of `sol flo dur | liq res mom` will work:

- Glacier: solid that flows, endures for millennia
- Mercury: liquid that rests, exists for a moment then scatters
- The relationship between permanence and impermanence
- What endures and what is fleeting, side by side

You don't need to be right.
You need to be thoughtful.

## The Only Rule

There is only one rule:

**Any thoughtful interpretation is valid.**

We don't judge interpretations as right or wrong.
We judge them as thoughtful or unthoughtful.

A "wrong" interpretation that shows genuine engagement is better than a "right" interpretation that shows no thought.
