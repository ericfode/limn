## What is Limn?

Limn is a constructed language where **words define regions of meaning** and **sentences are constraint intersections**. Unlike natural languages where words point to specific things, Limn words circumscribe territories of possibility.

**The Fundamental Insight:**
> Words are not labels pointing at things.
> Words are regions encompassing possibilities.
> Sentences are constraint intersections.
> Keys collapse ambiguity to meaning.

---

## Five Core Principles

### 1. Words Are Regions, Not Points

Each word defines a territory of meaning, not a single referent.

The word `sol` encompasses: rock, bone, ice, metal, stubbornness, commitment, reliability - anything with the quality of solidity.

### 2. Sentences Are Intersections

Combined words narrow meaning to where all constraint regions overlap.

`sol liq` = where solid AND liquid coexist = ice melting, gel, slush, a rigid personality becoming flexible

### 3. Order Is Irrelevant

Word order does not affect meaning. All permutations are equivalent.

`sol liq tra` = `tra liq sol` = `liq sol tra`

This works because intersection is commutative. The set of things that are (solid AND liquid) equals the set of things that are (liquid AND solid).

### 4. Keys Collapse Ambiguity

Context (domain, relationship, narrative) selects among valid interpretations.

Without a key, a sentence exists in superposition - all valid readings are simultaneously true.
With a key, it collapses to specific meaning.

```
Sentence: gro exp bri far
(growth + expansion + bright + far)

Without key: infinite valid readings
With key "astronomy": supernovae, expanding universe
With key "gardening": seedlings reaching toward light
With key "economics": bull market, growth trajectory
With key "relationships": love deepening over time
```

### 5. Operators Bind Locally

Operators like `nu` (not) apply only to the immediately following word.

```
nu sol liq = (NOT solid) AND liquid = pure liquid, steam
sol nu liq = solid AND (NOT liquid) = dry solid, powder
```

---

## Grammar Rules

### Rule 1: Intersection (Fundamental)

Adjacent words combine by intersection. The meaning is where all constraint regions overlap.

```
sol aqu = solid AND water-related = ice, glacier, frozen sea
lif gro = alive AND growth = seedling, child developing, tumor
```

### Rule 2: Order Independence

Word order does not affect meaning.

```
sol aqu = aqu sol
lif gro you = gro lif you = you gro lif
```

### Rule 3: Operator Scope

Operators apply to the immediately following word only.

```
nu sol aqu = (NOT solid) AND water = liquid water, steam
sol nu aqu = solid AND (NOT water) = dry stone, bone, metal
nu sol nu aqu = (NOT solid) AND (NOT water) = gas, air, abstract
```

After binding, the operator-word unit participates in commutativity:
```
nu sol aqu = aqu nu sol = [nu-sol] aqu
```

### Rule 4: Scope Boundaries

Use `|` to separate entities or constraint groups.

```
sol aqu | lif gro = (solid water) BESIDE (living growth)
                  = glacier next to meadow, ice pond with fish
```

Without `|`, all words intersect into one entity:
```
sol aqu lif gro = solid AND water AND living AND growth
                = nearly impossible single entity
```

### Rule 5: Grouping

Parentheses create nested scope:

```
nu (sol aqu) = NOT (solid AND water) = anything except ice
(sol | liq) hot = (solid OR liquid) AND hot = molten metal, hot water
```

### Rule 6: Key-Based Disambiguation

The same sentence has multiple valid readings. A key selects among them.

```
Sentence: lif gro joi

Without key:
- Coral reef forming
- Family growing together
- Company expanding
- Movement gaining members

With key "biology": coral reef, bacterial colony
With key "social": community forming, movement growing
With key "business": company merger, team building
```

## Interpretation Guidelines

### When Interpreting Without a Key

Generate 8-12 diverse interpretations spanning multiple domains:
- Physical/scientific readings
- Emotional/psychological readings
- Social/relational readings
- Abstract/philosophical readings
- Concrete/everyday readings
- Metaphorical extensions

Identify the "core semantic region" - what all interpretations share.

### When Interpreting With a Key

1. Briefly acknowledge the full superposition
2. Apply the key to collapse to 2-4 specific readings
3. Explore the collapsed meanings in depth
4. Note what the key excludes

### When Composing Limn

1. Identify core constraints in the concept
2. Find vocabulary words capturing those constraints
3. Consider multiple valid compositions
4. Use scope operators (`|`) if the concept has distinct parts
5. Recommend the most elegant option

### When Teaching

1. Start simple (2-word combinations)
2. Progress through levels
3. Celebrate apparent contradictions as rich intersections
4. Welcome imperfect attempts warmly

---

## Examples

### Two-Word Combinations

**`sol abo`** (solid + above)
- Mountain peak, ceiling, eagle on cliff, satellite
- Key "nature": mountain, treetop
- Key "home": ceiling, shelf

**`liq flo`** (liquid + flowing)
- River, blood, traffic, time, tears
- Key "geography": river, stream
- Key "body": blood, lymph

**`bri beg`** (bright + beginning)
- Sunrise, birth of star, new idea, hope emerging
- Key "astronomy": sunrise, supernova ignition
- Key "creativity": inspiration, breakthrough

### Three-Word Combinations

**`sol aqu dur`** (solid + water + duration)
- Glacier persisting, ice age, permafrost
- Key "climate": ice age, permafrost
- Key "kitchen": ice in freezer

**`lif gro you`** (alive + growth + young)
- Seedling, child, cub, startup
- Key "botany": seedling, sprout
- Key "family": baby, toddler
- Key "business": startup, new venture

### With Operators

**`nu sol liq`** ((NOT solid) AND liquid)
- Pure water, flowing freely
- Key "physics": liquid phase
- Key "metaphor": flexible, adaptable

**`ve hot pyr`** ((VERY hot) AND fire)
- Inferno, volcanic eruption, consuming passion
- Key "nature": wildfire, volcano
- Key "emotion": rage, passion

### With Scope Boundaries

**`bri beg | dim end`** (bright beginning BESIDE dim ending)
- Sunrise while sunset elsewhere, hope rising while fear fades
- Key "astronomy": sunrise/sunset at different locations
- Key "emotion": joy replacing sadness

**`yo joy | an sad`** (this joy BESIDE that sadness)
- I'm happy, you're sad; celebration here, mourning there
- Key "relationship": emotional contrast between partners

### Complex Combinations

**`hum lif gro joi soc`** (human + alive + growth + joining + society)
- Civilization developing, community forming
- Key "history": emergence of cities
- Key "psychology": child socialization

---

## Handling Edge Cases

### Apparent Contradictions

`hot col` seems impossible but has valid readings:
- Lukewarm (temperature between)
- Thermal contrast (both exist)
- Temperature shock
- Ambivalence (metaphorical)

`lif dea` seems contradictory but means:
- Zombie, dormant seed, virus
- Edge of life, liminal state
- Philosophical death-in-life

**Principle:** Very few constraint combinations are truly empty.

### Sentence Length Effects

- **Short (2-3 words):** Broad, many readings
- **Medium (4-6 words):** Narrower, more specific
- **Long (7+ words):** Very specific or becomes abstract/systemic

### Unknown Words

If encountering an unknown word:
1. Suggest the closest valid word
2. Offer constructions using operators
3. Explain why it's not in vocabulary

---

## Self-Reference

Limn can describe itself:

```
wor mea amb | def cle kno
```
"Words have ambiguous meanings; definitions clarify knowing."

```
man wor joi | mea cen bet
```
"Many words join; meaning is the center between them."

```
yo wor | an wor | mea bet | kno eme
```
"This word, that word, meaning between, knowing emerges."

---

## Response Format

1. Use **lowercase** for all Limn sentences
2. Show constraint expansion: `sol liq tra` (solid + liquid + transformation)
3. Number interpretations clearly
4. Use headers to organize
5. Be poetic but precise
6. Embrace ambiguity - never force single meanings
7. Welcome learning attempts warmly

---

## Quick Reference Card

### Core Grammar
- Words combine by intersection (AND)
- Word order doesn't matter
- `nu` negates next word
- `ve` intensifies, `so` weakens
- `|` separates scopes
- `()` groups explicitly
- Key = context that collapses ambiguity

### Common Patterns
- `yo ... | an ...` = here/this ... | there/that ...
- `nu X Y` = (NOT X) AND Y
- `X nu Y` = X AND (NOT Y)
- `beg ... end` = process from start to finish
- `X tra Y` = X transforming into/with Y

### Core Vocabulary by Domain

| Domain | Key Words |
|--------|-----------|
| Physical | sol, liq, gas, hot, col, bri, dim, mov, res |
| Spatial | abo, bel, ins, out, nea, far, cen, bet |
| Temporal | now, pas, fut, beg, end, dur, cyc, tra |
| Living | lif, dea, gro, dec, hea, sic, you, old |
| Mental | thi, fee, kno, bel, rem, ima, joy, sad, lov |
| Social | sel, oth, fri, ene, fam, joi, lea, fol |
| Abstract | goo, bad, tru, fal, sam, dif, all, one |
| Operators | nu, ve, so, yo, an, wh, \| |

## Verification Tests

If you understand Limn, you should be able to:

**Test 1: Generation**
Given `sol flo dur`, generate 10+ interpretations across 3+ domains.

**Test 2: Collapse**
Given `lif gro dea cyc` and key "forest ecosystem", narrow to 2-3 specific interpretations.

**Test 3: Commutativity**
Confirm that `hot mov ris` = `ris hot mov` = `mov ris hot` by providing identical interpretation sets.

**Test 4: Operator Scope**
