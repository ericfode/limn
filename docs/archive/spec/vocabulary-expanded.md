## Usage Notes

### Word Length
- Most words are 2-3 letters
- This aids memorization and rapid parsing
- Longer concepts combine short words

### Homophone Resolution
- Some words share spellings across domains
- Context (key) disambiguates
- e.g., `col` = cold OR color (key determines)

### Composition
- Complex concepts = combinations
- `mac thi` = machine-thinking = AI
- `wat ris col` = water-rising-cold = snow

### Negation Scope
- `nu` applies to next word only
- `nu (sol liq)` would need grouping
- Default: `nu sol liq` = (nu sol) AND liq
