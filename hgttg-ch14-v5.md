### [14.2] Looking Back

> Arthur looked down at the planet receding below them.

```limn
Arthur see bel | wrl awa
```

### [14.3] Slartibartfast's Farewell

> Slartibartfast had said goodbye. He was going back to building coastlines.

```limn

### [14.4] Earth Mark Two

> He mentioned they were rebuilding Earth. A new commission. Arthur might want to visit.

```limn

```

- A new Earth. Would Arthur like to come?

### [14.5] Arthur's Decision

## Looking Forward

### [14.6] Zaphod's Announcement

> "Right!" said Zaphod. "Now we need to eat. I know just the place."

```limn
Zaphod say : rig | now req nut | kno whr
```

- `nut` = nutrient/food (verified)

### [14.7] The Restaurant

> "The Restaurant at the End of the Universe. Best food anywhere. Or anywhen."

```limn
Zaphod say : rst @ end al | goo nut | al whr ± al dur
```

- `rst` = restaurant (verified)
- `end al` = end of everything = end of universe
- `al whr ± al dur` = all-where superposed with all-duration = anywhere or anywhen
- Superposition captures the temporal paradox of the restaurant

### [14.8] Ford Is Interested

```limn
Ford : joy^0.5 | alw des arv
```

### [14.9] Trillian Navigates

## Reflections

### [14.12] The Guide's Wisdom

> Arthur opened the Guide. He looked up the entry on the meaning of life.

```limn
Arthur opn gui | see : mea lif
```

- `opn` = open (verified)
- `mea lif` = meaning of life

### [14.13] The Entry

> The Guide's entry on the meaning of life was brief: "42. See also: the Question."

```limn
gui say : mea lif | fou dek two | see que
```

- Callback to Ch 10 — the number echoes

### [14.14] Arthur Closes the Guide

> Arthur closed the Guide. Some things were better not known.

```limn
Arthur clo gui | ex kno : nu goo
```

- `clo` = close (cloud/vapor in DB, but contextually: closing)
- **Note:** `clo` = cloud/vapor in DB. Strain: using for "close" action. Alternative: `end opn` (end opening). Keeping `clo` for readability.
- `ex kno` = some knowing (existential) = some things known
- `nu goo` = not good = better not known

### [14.15] Don't Panic

> The Guide's cover gleamed in the starlight. DON'T PANIC.

```limn
gui cov : "nu pani^1" @ sun
```

- Full circle from Ch 1. The cover. The words. The stars.

### [14.16] The Stars

> The stars stretched endlessly before them. Cold. Beautiful. Indifferent.

```limn
sun al bef | cld bea^0.9 | cal^1
```

- `cld` = cold (verified — existed in DB)
- `bea^0.9` = beauty at 90%
- `cal^1` = calm at maximum = cosmic indifference

### [14.17] The Journey Continues

> The Heart of Gold accelerated into the infinite dark. The adventure was just beginning.

```limn
"Heart of Gold" acc → dar^1 | myt : bef
```

- `acc` = accelerate (verified)
- `myt : bef` = story/myth: before = the story is just beginning
- The final line: the myth is ahead of them, not behind
