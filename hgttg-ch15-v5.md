## The Crew

### [15.1] Zaphod

> Zaphod Beeblebrox. Galactic President. Thief. Two heads, three arms, one brain working.

```limn
Zaphod : lea glx | tak | two hea tri arm | on bra wrk
```

- Character summary. The contradiction is structural.

### [15.2] Ford

> Ford Prefect. Researcher. Fifteen years stranded on Earth. His entry: "Mostly harmless."

```limn
Ford : wrk gui glx | 15 yea on plnt Arthur | "bad^0.1"
```

- Callback to Ch 2 — the famous entry

### [15.3] Trillian

> Trillian. Astrophysicist. The only sane one. She left Earth voluntarily.

```limn
Trillian : wom kno^0.9 | on hum cal | awa plnt : des
```

- `wom kno^0.9` = woman knowing at 90% = intelligent woman
- `awa plnt : des` = away from planet by desire = left voluntarily

### [15.4] Marvin

> Marvin the Paranoid Android. Brain the size of a planet. GPP. Genuine People Personality. Depressed.

```limn
Marvin : mac*hum | bra big as plnt | fee^1 | sad^0.99
```

- `fee^1` = feeling at maximum = Genuine People Personality (designed to feel)
- Callback to Ch 5 — the same patterns

### [15.5] Arthur

> Arthur Dent. Englishman. His planet was demolished on a Thursday. He still wants tea.

```limn
Arthur : hum plnt dem^1 | tsd | des tee sta
```

---

## The Numbers

### [15.6] What We Know

> The answer is 42. The Question is unknown. The Earth was the computer finding the Question. The Vogons destroyed it.

```limn
ans = fou dek two | que = nu kno | plnt Arthur = mac*com que | vog dem^1
```

- The entire plot in one expression

### [15.7] What We Don't Know

> We don't know why Zaphod stole the ship. We don't know what the Question is. We don't know where they're going.

```limn
nu kno : Zaphod tak shp why
nu kno : que
nu kno : whr
```

- Three unknowns. Three lines. The shape of the sequel.

## The Guide's Final Entry

### [15.8] On Earth

> The Guide's entry on Earth now reads: "Mostly harmless." Two words. Ford's entire research, compressed.

```limn
gui : plnt Arthur | "bad^0.1" | two wor | Ford wrk al → two wor
```

- `al → two wor` = everything transforms to two words
- The cosmic joke: all of Earth, reduced to a gradient

### [15.9] On Life

> The Guide has much to say about life. Most of it is wrong. All of it is interesting.

```limn
gui : man say lif | mst bad^0.8 | al cur
```

- `mst bad^0.8` = mostly wrong
- `al cur` = all curious/interesting

### [15.10] On Panic

> The Guide's cover says it all. In large, friendly letters: DON'T PANIC.

```limn
gui cov : al | "nu pani^1" @ big*fri
```

- The final statement. The Guide covers everything with one instruction.
- Large, friendly letters. The same words that started Arthur's journey.

## End of Book One

### [15.11] The Universe

> The Universe is a big place. Much bigger than you think. Vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big.

```limn
al : big | big ma thi | big ma thi^1
```

- Three stages of bigness, each exceeding thought
- Callback to Ch 9 [9.15]: `big ma thi^1` = bigger than maximum thought

### [15.12] Don't Panic

> Don't Panic.

```limn
nu pani^1
```

- Two words. End of Book One.
