## The Revelation

### [11.1] The Mice

> Trillian's two white mice were not what they seemed.

```limn
Trillian sma org two : nu sa
```

- `sma org` = small organism = mouse (composition)
- `org` = organism (verified)
- `nu sa` = not same = not what they seemed

### [11.2] Pan-Dimensional Beings

> They were, in fact, pan-dimensional super-intelligent beings who had commissioned the building of Earth.

```limn
sa = hum kno^1 | dee^1 | sa req mak plnt Arthur
```

- `hum kno^1` = humans knowing at maximum = super-intelligent beings
- `dee^1` = deep at maximum = pan-dimensional (profoundly other)
- `sa req mak` = same ones required the making = they commissioned

### [11.3] Frankie and Benjy

> Their names, in mouse form, were Frankie and Benjy.

```limn
Frankie and Benjy : sma org cov
```

- `sma org cov` = small organism surface = mouse form (their exterior/cover)

### [11.4] They Had Been Waiting

> They had been running on their wheels, waiting. For ten million years.

```limn
sa wai | dur dek mil yea | wrk
```

### [11.5] The Problem

> Earth had been destroyed five minutes before the program finished. The Question was lost.

```limn
plnt dem^1 fiv mom bef ful | que : los^1
```

## The Mice Want Answers

### [11.6] Arthur Is the Key

> The mice realized: Arthur Dent was the last living product of the Earth computer program. The Question might be in his brain.

```limn
sma org see : Arthur = end mac*com plnt | que pos in bra Arthur
```

- `end mac*com plnt` = ending of the computer planet = last product of Earth

### [11.7] A Simple Proposal

> "We'd like to buy your brain," said Frankie Mouse pleasantly.

```limn
Frankie say cal^0.8 : des Arthur bra | giv gol
```

- `des Arthur bra` = desire Arthur's brain
- `giv gol` = give gold = willing to pay

### [11.8] Arthur Objects

> "What?" said Arthur.

```limn
Arthur : sur^0.95 | "nu"
```

### [11.9] They'll Take Good Care of It

> "Oh, we'll look after it. We just need to slice it up a bit. Run some tests."

```limn
Frankie say : pro bra | req fra | tes
```

- `fra` = fragment (verified) — slice it up
- `tes` = test (verified)

### [11.10] Arthur Still Objects

> "You want to slice up my brain?" said Arthur. "Absolutely not."

```limn
Arthur say : bra fra te | nu^1
```

- `nu^1` — absolute negation. Not happening.

### [11.11] The Mice Persist

> "Don't be difficult," said Benjy. "You won't be needing it."

```limn
Benjy say : nu dis | nu req bra
```

- `dis` = disagree/oppose (verified) — don't be difficult

### [11.12] Ford Intervenes

> Ford stepped in. "I think we should probably leave now," he said.

```limn
Ford say : mov awa now we
```
