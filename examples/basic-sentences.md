## Patterns to Notice

1. **Physical-Metaphor Parallels:** Many sentences have both literal physical readings and emotional/abstract metaphorical readings that share the same structure.

2. **Contradiction as Liminality:** Sentences with apparent contradictions (`bri nox`, `gro dec`) don't become meaningless - they point to boundary states, transitions, complexity.

3. **Key Collapse:** Notice how different keys narrow interpretation dramatically. The sentence is the same; the key is what changes.

4. **Commutative Invariance:** You can reorder any of these sentences without changing meaning. `lif gro you` = `you gro lif` = `gro you lif`.

5. **Domain Crossing:** The same sentence often makes sense across very different domains. This is a feature, not a bug.

---

## Practice

Choose 5 sentences above and:
1. Come up with 2 new interpretations not listed
2. Create a key that would make each interpretation the primary one
3. Reorder the words to verify the meaning stays the same
