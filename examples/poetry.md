# Limn Poetry

*Five poems with annotations*

---

Poetry in Limn is not like poetry in natural language. There are no metaphors to construct - every sentence is already a superposition of literal and figurative meanings. There is no word order to manipulate for rhythm - all orderings are equivalent.

Instead, Limn poetry works through:
- **Constraint collision** - the tension between intersecting regions
- **Scope juxtaposition** - the `|` operator creating dialectic
- **Negation landscapes** - `nu` carving voids in meaning-space
- **Controlled ambiguity** - multiple readings existing in harmony

Each poem below is presented with multiple valid readings. None is "correct." The key is yours to bring.

## Poem 1: Threshold

```
bri beg lif | nox end lif
abo dur ris | bel dur fal
goo nu goo | bad nu bad
```

### Line by Line

**Line 1:** `bri beg lif | nox end lif`
- bright + beginning + alive | dark + ending + alive
- Constraints: (luminous origin of life) beside (shadowed conclusion of life)
- Readings:
  - Dawn and dusk of a single day
  - Birth and death of a single being
  - Hope at the start, acceptance at the end
  - Consciousness flickering between illumination and oblivion

**Line 2:** `abo dur ris | bel dur fal`
- above + duration + rising | below + duration + falling
- Constraints: (persistent ascent) beside (persistent descent)
- Readings:
  - Smoke rising, ash settling
  - Spirit ascending, body returning to earth
  - Ambition and gravity in eternal tension
  - The two directions of all motion

**Line 3:** `goo nu goo | bad nu bad`
- good + not-good | bad + not-bad
- Constraints: (the negation of value) twice over
- Readings:
  - The collapse of moral categories
  - Everything is neither fully good nor fully bad
  - Beyond judgment
  - The place where dualities dissolve

### Whole Poem Readings

**Reading 1: A Meditation on Death**
The first line traces life's arc from hopeful beginning to dark ending. The second line shows the soul's ascent while the body descends. The third line suggests that beyond death, categories of good and bad no longer apply. The threshold is the dissolution of judgment.

**Reading 2: The Diurnal Cycle**
Dawn wakes life; dusk ends the day. Heat rises; coolness settles. Neither day nor night is good or bad - just the rhythm continuing. The threshold is every twilight.

**Reading 3: A Critique of Dualism**
Light-beginning and dark-ending are named but then undermined. Up and down happen simultaneously. Good and bad negate each other. The threshold is the recognition that all binaries are constructs.

## Poem 2: The Waiting Heat

```
hot dur unt
lif bel sol | ris abo bri
sud nu sud nu sud
```

### Line by Line

**Line 1:** `hot dur unt`
- hot + duration + until
- Constraints: heat persisting while waiting for something
- Readings:
  - Fever waiting to break
  - Summer waiting to end
  - Passion sustained in anticipation
  - The long burn before release

**Line 2:** `lif bel sol | ris abo bri`
- alive + below + solid | rising + above + bright
- Constraints: (life beneath the surface) beside (ascent toward light)
- Readings:
  - Seed underground / shoot breaking through
  - Trapped life / hope of escape
  - The buried and the soaring
  - Potential and actualization

**Line 3:** `sud nu sud nu sud`
- sudden + not-sudden + not + sudden
- Constraints: sudden, then negated, then negated again
- Readings:
  - The perpetual almost-moment
  - Waiting for the break that doesn't come
  - Repetition that mimics endlessness
  - The edge of change, cycling

### Whole Poem Readings

**Reading 1: The Seed**
Heat in the soil. Life waiting below the surface. The shoot rises when conditions allow. But the breakthrough is always almost-happening, then not, then almost again. The poem enacts the patience of germination.

**Reading 2: Anxiety**
The hot duration is anxious anticipation. Something is alive but trapped. It wants to rise and shine. But the sudden moment of change keeps not-arriving. The poem is the structure of anxiety itself.

**Reading 3: Love Unrequited**
Heat sustained, waiting. The self buried, hoping to rise into the light of another's attention. But the moment never quite arrives - sudden, not-sudden, not-sudden again. The waiting that might never end.

## Poem 3: Mirrors

```
sel | oth
sel oth | oth sel
sel nu sel | oth nu oth
```

### Line by Line

**Line 1:** `sel | oth`
- self | other
- Constraints: the basic division
- Readings:
  - I and you
  - Subject and object
  - Inside and outside
  - The fundamental split

**Line 2:** `sel oth | oth sel`
- self+other | other+self
- Constraints: the same intersection, twice named
- Readings:
  - The relationship (from both sides)
  - Intersubjectivity
  - The space between (named from each position)
  - Commutativity made visible

**Line 3:** `sel nu sel | oth nu oth`
- self + not-self | other + not-other
- Constraints: each dissolving into its opposite
- Readings:
  - The self seen through the other
  - The other recognized as having selfhood
  - Boundaries collapsing
  - Mutual recognition

### Whole Poem Readings

**Reading 1: The Phenomenology of Recognition**
First, self and other exist separately. Then, we see each contains the other (the relationship, the between). Finally, each is negated - the self is also not-self (seen externally), the other is also not-other (has their own interiority). The mirrors reflect infinitely.

**Reading 2: Love**
Separation. Then union (the we). Then the deeper recognition: I am not only myself to you, and you are not only other to me. Love is the dissolution of boundaries.

**Reading 3: The Structure of Consciousness**
Consciousness requires self and other. But in reflection, each is revealed as containing its opposite. The poem traces Hegel's dialectic: thesis (separation), antithesis (intersection), synthesis (mutual negation revealing unity).

## Poem 4: Origin / End

```
ori | des
ori des | des ori
ori des tra | des ori tra
nu mov
```

### Line by Line

**Line 1:** `ori | des`
- origin | destination
- Constraints: beginning point beside ending point
- Readings:
  - Start and finish
  - Where I came from | where I'm going
  - Birth and death
  - Home and exile

**Line 2:** `ori des | des ori`
- origin+destination | destination+origin
- Constraints: the point that is both (twice named)
- Readings:
  - The same place seen differently
  - Returning home
  - The journey that ends where it began
  - Circularity

**Line 3:** `ori des tra | des ori tra`
- origin+destination+transformation | destination+origin+transformation
- Constraints: the change that happens in the journey
- Readings:
  - We transform en route
  - The return is not to the same place
  - The journey changes both poles
  - You can't go home again (because you've changed)

**Line 4:** `nu mov`
- not + movement
- Constraints: stillness, the absence of journey
- Readings:
  - After all that: rest
  - The journey's end is non-journey
  - Arrival means stopping
  - Or: there was never any movement at all

### Whole Poem Readings

**Reading 1: The Hero's Journey**
We leave home, head toward a goal. But the goal becomes the new home; home becomes the old destination. The journey transforms both. And at the end: stillness. The adventure concludes in rest.

**Reading 2: Odysseus**
Ithaca is both where he came from and where he's going. But returning, everything has changed - he is changed, home is changed. The final stillness: death, or peace.

**Reading 3: Existence**
We come from somewhere (origin), head somewhere (destination). But these swap and blur. We transform constantly. And then: no movement. The stillness that frames all motion.

## Poem 5: After the Argument

```
end | beg nu beg
hot dur unt | nox dur bel
goo bad | bad goo
bri sol | nox lin
sud nu sud nu sud
lif nu lif | lif
```

### Line by Line

**Line 1:** `end | beg nu beg`
- ending | beginning + not-beginning
- Constraints: an ending beside a failed beginning
- Readings:
  - Is this an ending or a failed restart?
  - The relationship: over? starting over?
  - Something ended, something couldn't start

**Line 2:** `hot dur unt | nox dur bel`
- hot + duration + until | dark + duration + below
- Constraints: heat waiting beside darkness sinking
- Readings:
  - Waiting for anger to cool
  - The hot waiting above, the cold settling below
  - Tension and depression, simultaneously

**Line 3:** `goo bad | bad goo`
- good+bad | bad+good
- Constraints: the same entanglement, twice
- Readings:
  - Love and anger intertwined
  - Can't separate the good from the bad
  - The relationship's contradiction

**Line 4:** `bri sol | nox lin`
- bright + solid | dark + linear
- Constraints: what was bright and stable beside what extends darkly
- Readings:
  - The good times (bright, solid) / the current dark path ahead
  - Memory of warmth / present shadow

**Line 5:** `sud nu sud nu sud`
- sudden not-sudden not-sudden
- Constraints: the moment that keeps not arriving
- Readings:
  - Waiting for the break
  - The resolution that doesn't come
  - Cycling in anticipation

**Line 6:** `lif nu lif | lif`
- alive + not-alive | alive
- Constraints: numbness beside continuing life
- Readings:
  - Am I dead inside, or just still here?
  - Feeling nothing, yet alive
  - The strange continuity after rupture

### Whole Poem Reading

**The Emotional Topology of Aftermath**

This is not a narrative. It's a map of feeling after conflict.

The first line holds the question: is this ending, or failed beginning? The second line captures the physical sensation: heat that won't dissipate above, darkness settling in the gut below. The third line refuses to separate love from pain. The fourth looks backward to bright stability, forward into dark linearity. The fifth line is the perpetual edge of change that keeps not arriving. The sixth is the strangest: numb (not-alive), yet somehow still alive. Still here.

The poem doesn't resolve. Neither does the feeling it describes.

## Notes on Limn Poetry

### What Limn Can Do That English Can't

1. **Simultaneous Superposition:** Every reading exists at once until a key collapses it. The poem doesn't have to choose.

2. **Constraint as Meaning:** The intersection of `hot dur unt` isn't a metaphor for waiting - it IS the structure of waiting, expressed directly.

3. **Negation as Carving:** `sud nu sud nu sud` creates meaning by repeated exclusion and inclusion, making a shape in semantic space.

4. **True Commutativity:** `goo bad | bad goo` makes the symmetry literal. The order cannot privilege one over the other.

### What Limn Can't Do That English Can

1. **Narrative Sequence:** "Then" is hard in Limn. These poems are states, not stories.

2. **Specific Reference:** "You" and "I" are sel/oth, but which specific you and I remains abstract.

3. **Irony and Subversion:** Limn means what it says. It can't wink.

4. **Sonic Texture:** Without word order mattering, Limn can't use enjambment, caesura, or rhythm in the traditional way.

### The Key in Poetry

These poems are presented without keys. Any reading is valid.

But a poet could attach a key:

> Key: "My divorce, 2024"
>
> `end | beg nu beg` = The marriage ending, the new life I couldn't start

> Key: "Climate grief"
>
> `hot dur unt` = The planet heating, waiting for catastrophe

The key doesn't change the poem. It changes what you see in it.

## Try Writing Your Own

1. Choose 3-4 emotions or states you want to hold simultaneously.
2. Find Limn words that intersect in those regions.
3. Use `|` to create tensions and juxtapositions.
4. Use `nu` to carve out the spaces between.
5. Don't resolve. Let the ambiguity breathe.

*In Limn, we write in weather patterns instead of words. We don't describe the storm - we set up the pressure systems and let them interact.*
