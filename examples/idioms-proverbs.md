# Limn Idioms and Proverbs

*Wisdom that changes with the key you bring*

---

Limn proverbs are not fixed truths. Each holds multiple interpretations in superposition until a context—a key—collapses the meaning. The same phrase offers different wisdom to different situations.

## Multi-Key Example: The Full Proverb Path

Consider bringing a specific key to multiple proverbs:

**Key: Divorce**

1. `end | beg nu beg` → Ending, or failed restart
2. `los fnd | fnd los` → I lost you; I found myself
3. `ful han dro | emp han cat` → I held too tight
4. `sel oth mak | oth sel mak` → We made each other; now we unmake
5. `end beg aga | beg end aga` → This ending is a beginning. This beginning will end.

The same proverbs read with **Key: Starting a business**:

1. `end | beg nu beg` → The old career ends; the new one begins
2. `los fnd | fnd los` → Risk losing to find success
3. `ful han dro | emp han cat` → Invest (let go) to receive returns
4. `sel oth mak | oth sel mak` → The founder makes the company; the company makes the founder
5. `end beg aga | beg end aga` → Every product launch ends the development, begins the sales

## Proverb Form in Limn

Notice the structure:

```
A B | B A
```

This **chiastic form** is natural in Limn because:
- The `|` creates symmetry
- Reversing the terms tests whether the relationship is commutative
- If both orderings are meaningful, the proverb holds deeper truth

A proverb that only works in one direction is incomplete. True Limn wisdom is symmetric.

---

```limn
wis old | old wis | wis new | new wis
```
> Wisdom is old. Old is wisdom. Wisdom is new. New is wisdom.

*All four. Simultaneously. That is Limn.*
