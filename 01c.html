<h1>Chapter 1C: The Trap</h1>
<br>
You applied **[KEY: HOSTILE-INTERCEPT]**.
<br>
The message collapses differently:
<br>
<div class="transmission"><div class="transmission-header">▌ INTERCEPTED ▐</div><pre class="limn-code"><code>hes lis | eye man | mov nu saf | te ord
</code></pre></div>
<br>
<blockquote>"We're listening. Many watchers. Your move isn't safe. What will you order?"</blockquote>
<br>
Your blood runs cold. This isn't from your network. It's from *them*.
<br>
The enemy captured Cardinal. They have Cardinal's communication codes. Now they're fishing—sending messages on your frequency, waiting to see who responds and how.
<br>
The `hes` isn't hesitation. It's mockery. *We're hesitant to act... until you give us something.*
<br>

<br>
<h2>The Architect's Game</h2>
<br>
You've never met the Architect. No one has—not and lived to report it. They run enemy counterintelligence like a chess game, always three moves ahead.
<br>
This message is a trap. Classic Architect:
<br>
1. **Capture asset** - Cardinal
2. **Compromise comms** - Use captured codes
3. **Fish for network** - See who responds
4. **Map structure** - Every response reveals relationships
5. **Roll up network** - Once mapped, eliminate
<br>
If you respond to this message as if it's from your agent, you confirm the channel is live. You reveal yourself as a handler. You give them a thread to pull.
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<h2>But What If You're Wrong?</h2>
<br>
The hostile-intercept reading is valid. But so are the others.
<br>
What if it really IS Rook, scared and reaching out?
What if it really IS Bishop, breaking silence to help?
<br>
If you treat a genuine cry for help as a trap, you abandon your people.
<br>
Limn holds all readings until collapsed. You chose this key. You entered this reality.
<br>
Now you have to act within it.
<br>

<h2>Choices</h2>
<br>
<blockquote>**→ [Silence](#02g)**</blockquote>
>
<blockquote>**Don't respond.** Give them nothing.</blockquote>
>
<blockquote>*[NO MESSAGE SENT]*</blockquote>
>
<blockquote>If it's a trap, silence is safety. They can't map what doesn't respond.</blockquote>
>
<blockquote>But if it's really your agent... you've just abandoned them.</blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote>**→ [Counter-Intelligence](#02h)**</blockquote>
>
<blockquote>**Feed them disinformation.** Turn the trap back on them.</blockquote>
>
<blockquote>```limn</blockquote>
<blockquote>iro con | age mov eas | loc bri nea | tim lon</blockquote>
<blockquote>```</blockquote>
>
<blockquote>*Ironic: Confirmed. Agent moving east. Location bridge near. Time extended.*</blockquote>
>
<blockquote>The `iro` marker inverts everything for anyone with your true key—but the enemy doesn't have it. They'll read: "Confirmed. Agent moving east. Bridge nearby. Plenty of time."</blockquote>
>
<blockquote>Send them chasing ghosts. Buy yourself room to operate.</blockquote>

<h2>The Information War</h2>
<br>
In Limn, the same message means different things to different readers. This is your weapon.
<br>
If the enemy intercepts your traffic, they read with their key—SURFACE at best, maybe COVER. They don't have TRUE. They definitely don't have GHOST.
<br>
You can speak in public and still keep secrets. But only if you're clever about it.
<br>

<br>
<h2>Incoming Noise</h2>
<br>
More messages. Different channels. Some might be real. Some might be probes.
<br>
<div class="transmission"><div class="transmission-header">▌ INTERCEPTED ▐</div><pre class="limn-code"><code>bis | col | loc dep | req joi
</code></pre></div>
<br>
<div class="transmission"><div class="transmission-header">▌ INTERCEPTED ▐</div><pre class="limn-code"><code>kni | loc kno | off hel | tim lim
</code></pre></div>
<br>
Are these your people? Or more fishing?
<br>
You can't answer everything. You can't trust anything.
<br>
Welcome to the Architect's game.
