# Limn Koans

*Phrases for contemplation*

## On Using These Koans

A koan is not solved but dissolved. These phrases are not puzzles with answers but containers for attention.

**Practice:**
1. Read the Limn aloud (pronunciation guide below)
2. Let the phrase exist without collapsing it
3. Notice which readings arise
4. Notice them arise and pass
5. Return to the phrase

The practice is the superposition itself.

## The Koans

### 1. `sel see sel`

## Commentary

### The Structure of Koans

Many koans follow patterns:

| Pattern | Structure | Effect |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Reversal | `A B \| B A` | Symmetry reveals non-duality |
| Self-reference | `X X` | Recursion creates depth |
| Negation dance | `X nu X \| nu X X` | Boundaries dissolve |
| Trinity | `A \| B \| bet` | Third term transcends duality |
| Identity paradox | `A B \| sam` | Difference collapses |

### Why Limn for Koans?

Traditional koans use paradox to break conceptual thinking. Limn koans work differently:

1. **No translation needed:** The phrase is the practice, not a translation of it
2. **Superposition is built in:** The paradox isn't stated but enacted
3. **Order-independence:** The mind can't grasp the "first" and "second" term
4. **Contemplation-ready:** Dense, brief, memorable

### The Practice

Don't solve. Dissolve.

Sit with `sel see sel`. Let it be strange. Let the strangeness be familiar. Let the familiar become strange again.

The phrase will not give up a secret meaning. The phrase IS the meaning. The practice IS the insight.

## For Teachers

These koans can be used in:

- **Meditation groups:** Shared contemplation
- **Writing practice:** Respond in Limn, then silence
- **Philosophy discussions:** Starting points, not conclusions
- **Personal practice:** Daily phrase, carried through activities

Suggested progression:
1. Simple reversals (#7, #6)
2. Self-reference (#1, #20)
3. Negation (#3, #8)
4. Trinity (#4, #12)
5. Time (#2, #10, #14)
6. Advanced paradox (#11, #16, #21)
