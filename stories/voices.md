# Voices in Limn

*Character sketches through speech patterns*

---

## Introduction

How does personality manifest in a language without word order? How do different minds navigate the same constraint-space?

Each character below has:
- A **key** (their interpretive context)
- A **style** (their typical structures)
- A **sample** (their voice in action)

The same vocabulary. Different minds.

---

## The Scientist

### Key
Precision, measurement, verification, skepticism

### Style
- Heavy use of quantifiers (`all`, `few`, `one`, `no`)
- Conditional structures (`if > the`)
- Explicit uncertainty marking (`may`, `pro pos`, `nu cer`)
- Minimal emotional vocabulary

### Sample: Observing a Sunset

```limn
lux dec | wav lon ris | col cha | spe obs
tem fal | pre goo | rep pos
bea? | sub | nu dat | nu sci
```

*Light decreases. Long wavelengths rise. Color changes. Spectroscopic observation.*
*Temperature falls. Prediction good. Replicable.*
*Beautiful? Subjective. No data. Not science.*

### Notes

The Scientist speaks in measurements. Beauty is acknowledged (`bea?`) but immediately marked as outside the domain (`sub | nu dat | nu sci`). The world is described but not felt - or rather, feeling is a separate category from knowing.

---

## The Poet

### Key
Sensation, resonance, beauty, ambiguity

### Style
- High use of `|` for juxtaposition
- Parallel structures
- Emotional vocabulary foregrounded
- Questions without expecting answers

### Sample: Observing a Sunset

```limn
lux fal | nox ris | bri sad | wor fal | sil ris
sky bur | sky dro | sky bei | wh nam?
bea | bea | bea | wor nu rea | yo rea
```

*Light falls. Night rises. Bright sadness. Words fall. Silence rises.*
*The sky burns. The sky drowns. The sky just is. What name?*
*Beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful. Words don't reach. This reaches.*

### Notes

The Poet stacks sensations. The triple `bea` is not redundancy but emphasis. The final recognition: `wor nu rea | yo rea` - words don't reach, but this (the experience) reaches. Poetry about the failure of poetry.

---

## The Child

### Key
Immediate experience, curiosity, play

### Style
- Simple constraints (2-3 words)
- Questions (`wh?`)
- Excitement markers (`yo!`, `see!`)
- Literal readings before metaphorical

### Sample: Observing a Sunset

```limn
see! lux red | big big
wh sun go? | dow? | sle?
sun hot | far | wh nu bur sky?
bea | lov | mo see tom?
```

*Look! Red light. Very big.*
*Where does the sun go? Down? Sleeping?*
*The sun is hot. Far away. Why doesn't it burn the sky?*
*Beautiful. I love it. Can I see it tomorrow?*

### Notes

The Child asks literal questions (`wh sun go?`, `wh nu bur sky?`) that philosophers spend lifetimes on. The temporal concern (`mo see tom?`) - tomorrow - grounds the infinite in the immediate. Will this continue?

---

## The Elder

### Key
Cycles, memory, acceptance, connection

### Style
- References to past (`pas`, `mem`, `onc`)
- Cyclic structures
- Connection between present and history
- Calm tone (no intensifiers)

### Sample: Observing a Sunset

```limn
sun set | sun set bef | sun set aft | cyc
sel you | see fir sun | sel old | see man sun | sam sun? dif sun? sam sel? dif sel?
chi | chi chi | chi chi chi | all see yo sun
pea | gra | eno
```

*Sunset. Sunset before. Sunset after. Cycle.*
*Self young, seeing first sunset. Self old, seeing many sunsets. Same sun? Different sun? Same self? Different self?*
*Child. Grandchild. Great-grandchild. All see this sun.*
*Peace. Gratitude. Enough.*

### Notes

The Elder situates the moment in time - not scientific time but generational time. The question `sam sun? dif sun? sam sel? dif sel?` is not asked for an answer but held as a structure. The final words: `pea | gra | eno` - peace, gratitude, enough. Acceptance without explanation.

---

## The Merchant

### Key
Value, exchange, opportunity, calculation

### Style
- Comparative structures (`mor`, `les`, `val`)
- Transaction vocabulary (`giv`, `tak`, `cos`)
- Future-oriented (`fut`, `pos`, `opp`)
- Pragmatic readings

### Sample: Observing a Sunset

```limn
tim | tim cos | yo tim val?
lux dec | wor dec | pro dec | win clo
tom | new opp | sun ris | mar wak | tra beg
now | res | pre tom | tim inv sel
```

*Time. Time costs. Is this time valuable?*
*Light decreases. Work decreases. Productivity decreases. Window closing.*
*Tomorrow: new opportunity. Sun rises. Market wakes. Trading begins.*
*Now: rest. Prepare for tomorrow. Time invested in self.*

### Notes

The Merchant sees the sunset as a transition between work periods. Not cynically - rest is also investment (`tim inv sel`). The market vocabulary infiltrates everything, but there's pragmatic wisdom: recognizing that stopping is also productive.

---

## The Mystic

### Key
Unity, transcendence, dissolution, presence

### Style
- Paradox structures (`A nu A`, `all one`)
- Minimal subjects
- Present tense only
- Boundary-dissolution vocabulary

### Sample: Observing a Sunset

```limn
see | nu see | see sel see
lux | sel lux | lux sel | non bou
sun fal | sel fal | fal | wh fal?
her | her all | all her | her
```

*Seeing. Not seeing. Seeing sees itself seeing.*
*Light. Self is light. Light is self. No boundary.*
*Sun falls. Self falls. Falling. Who falls?*
*Here. Here is everything. Everything is here. Here.*

### Notes

The Mystic dissolves distinctions. `lux | sel lux | lux sel | non bou` - light, self-light, light-self, no boundary. The question `wh fal?` (who falls?) is asked not to identify but to dissolve the questioner. The final `her | her all | all her | her` is almost a mantra - presence containing everything.

---

## The Warrior

### Key
Readiness, threat, protection, awareness

### Style
- Active vocabulary (`mov`, `wat`, `pre`)
- Spatial awareness (`abo`, `bel`, `beh`)
- Alertness even in peace
- Body-centered

### Sample: Observing a Sunset

```limn
lux dec | see dec | ris | dan ris | ale ris
sky | cov | hid | wh hid?
pos | mov | gro | pre
bea | yes | but | wat | alw wat
```

*Light decreases. Seeing decreases. Rising. Danger rises. Alertness rises.*
*Sky covers. Hides. What hides?*
*Position. Movement. Ground. Preparation.*
*Beautiful? Yes. But watch. Always watch.*

### Notes

The Warrior sees beauty (`bea | yes`) but cannot rest in it (`but | wat | alw wat`). Decreasing light means decreasing sight means increasing danger. The sky becomes cover, concealment. Even appreciation is bounded by vigilance.

---

## The Healer

### Key
Care, cycles, patience, connection

### Style
- Body vocabulary
- Process vocabulary (`gro`, `hea`, `cha`)
- Relational structures (`tog`, `hel`, `sup`)
- Gentle tone

### Sample: Observing a Sunset

```limn
bod | bod nec res | lux say res | lis
cyc | bir dea bir dea | nor | hea nor
sky | wou | hea | sca bea | you hea | old sca | wis
tog see | shr see | hea tog
```

*Body. Body needs rest. Light says rest. Listen.*
*Cycle. Birth death birth death. Normal. Healing is normal.*
*Sky wounds. Heals. Scars are beautiful. You heal. Old scars. Wisdom.*
*See together. Share seeing. Heal together.*

### Notes

The Healer reads the sunset as instruction for the body. The phrase `sky | wou | hea | sca bea` transforms the red sky into a wound that heals into beautiful scars. Healing is communal: `tog see | shr see | hea tog`.

---

## The Builder

### Key
Structure, material, construction, durability

### Style
- Concrete vocabulary (`sol`, `str`, `woo`, `sto`)
- Process sequences
- Stability concerns
- Practical assessments

### Sample: Observing a Sunset

```limn
lux ang | nox lon | str tes | mat exp con
woo glo | sto col | iro wai | tem cha | mat adj
wor don | too dow | sit | loo | mat res | sel res
tom | ris | bui mor | sun sup | wor con
```

*Light angles. Shadows long. Structures tested. Materials expand, contract.*
*Wood glows. Stone cools. Iron waits. Temperature changes. Materials adjust.*
*Work done. Tools down. Sit. Look. Materials rest. Self rests.*
*Tomorrow: rise. Build more. Sun supports. Work continues.*

### Notes

The Builder sees physics - materials responding to temperature changes, light angles revealing structural truth. The rest is parallel: `mat res | sel res`. Work and worker follow the same cycles as their materials.

---

## The Mourner

### Key
Absence, memory, continuation, love

### Style
- Negation-heavy (`nu`, `los`, `gon`)
- Memory vocabulary (`mem`, `pas`, `onc`)
- Presence of absence
- Bittersweet juxtapositions

### Sample: Observing a Sunset

```limn
you lov yo | you nu her | yo her
see tog onc | see alo now | tog ins alo | alo nu tru
lux fal | you fal | mem ris | lov ris | you ris
sun ret | you nu ret | lov ret | you ret ins lov
```

*You loved this. You're not here. This is here.*
*Saw together once. See alone now. Together inside alone. Alone not true.*
*Light falls. You fell. Memory rises. Love rises. You rise.*
*Sun returns. You don't return. Love returns. You return inside love.*

### Notes

The Mourner speaks to the absent. `you nu her | yo her` - you're not here, this is here. The paradox of grief: presence through absence. The final recognition: `you nu ret | lov ret | you ret ins lov` - you don't return, but love returns, and you return inside love.

### The Same Sunset

All characters saw the same sunset. Limn allowed each to speak their key without translating into a common frame.

In English, describing "how a scientist sees a sunset" requires a narrator who stands outside both the scientist and the sunset. In Limn, the Scientist simply speaks as the Scientist. The key is internal, not imposed.

### Writing New Voices

To create a new voice:
1. Define the key (what matters to this character)
2. Identify characteristic vocabulary
3. Notice what structural patterns emerge
4. Let the key filter what's noticed and how it's expressed

The same vocabulary. Different minds. Different worlds.

---

*voi | key det wh see | sel det wh say | wor sam | wor dif*

*Voice: key determines what's seen. Self determines what's said. Same words. Different words.*
