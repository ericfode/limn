# What If: Bishop Was Always Loyal

*An alternate reading where all Bishop's actions were genuine.*

---

## The Evidence Reread

```limn
bis act | rea all | thr len loy
```

### Why Bishop Knew So Much
```limn
bis sou | yea cul | ris tak | ins ene org | pro net
```

> Bishop's source: Years of cultivating. Risk taken. Inside enemy organization. Protecting network.

Bishop wasn't suspicious because they had enemy contacts. They HAD enemy contacts because they were the best at penetration work.

---

### Why Bishop Seemed Cold
```limn
bis col | pro | emo dan | emo exp | col = saf
```

> Bishop's coldness: Protection. Emotion is danger. Emotion exposes. Cold equals safe.

Field agents learn to suppress. The cold ones survive longest.

---

### Why Bishop Pushed
```limn
bis pus | tim kno | car tim kno | urj gen
```

> Bishop pushed because: Time known. Cardinal's time known. Urgency genuine.

When Bishop said time was short, they meant it. They knew the interrogation schedule.

## The Alternate Story

```limn
if bis loy | sto dif | you dif | cho dif
```

### If You Trusted Fully
```limn
tru ful | coo fas | ext ear | car les pai | vic eas
```

> Full trust: Faster coordination. Earlier extraction. Cardinal less pain. Easier victory.

Your hesitation cost Cardinal hours of suffering.

---

### If You Trusted Partially
```limn
tru par | coo slo | ext lat | car mor pai | vic har
```

> Partial trust: Slower coordination. Later extraction. Cardinal more pain. Harder victory.

Your caution was reasonable but costly.

---

### If You Didn't Trust
```limn
tru nu | bis alo | bis try alo | bis may fai | you los mor
```

> No trust: Bishop alone. Bishop tries alone. Bishop may fail. You lose more.

Bishop would have tried anyway. Without your support, they might have died trying.

---

## Bishop's Truth

```limn
bis tru | nev tra | nev dou | alw loy | alw alo
```

> Bishop's truth: Never traitor. Never doubted mission. Always loyal. Always alone.

```limn
bis kno you sus | bis und why | bis con ser | bis con alw
```

> Bishop knew you suspected. Bishop understood why. Bishop continued serving. Bishop continued always.

---

## The Cost of Suspicion

```limn
sus cos | tim cos | tru cos | pai cos | all cos
```

> Suspicion costs. Time costs. Trust costs. Pain costs. All costs.

```limn
sus sav te | som tim | thi tim | may be | nu kno
```

> Suspicion saves sometimes? This time? Maybe. Never know.

---

## Reflection

```limn
loy loo tra | tra loo loy | dif unk | alw unk
```

> Loyalty looks like betrayal. Betrayal looks like loyalty. Difference unknown. Always unknown.

```limn
bis loy | bis die for you | you nev kno | you nev cer
```

> Bishop loyal. Bishop would die for you. You never knew. You were never certain.

```limn
tru = ris | dou = ris | cho = ris | liv = ris
```

> Trust is risk. Doubt is risk. Choice is risk. Living is risk.

---

```limn
alt end | bis loy alw | you kno now | too lat te | nev too lat
```

*Alternate ending: Bishop was loyal always. You know now. Too late? Never too late to learn.*
