# What If: No One Came

*The darkest timeline. Cardinal alone.*

---

## Hour 48: Breaking

```limn

```

```limn

```

> No one came. No one's coming. Time up. Will gone. Breaking.

```limn
the ask | I ans | the ask | I ans | nu cho
```

> They ask. I answer. They ask. I answer. No choice.

---

## What Cardinal Gave

```limn
car gav | aft bre
```

```limn
key tru | net 9 | han yuk | saf hou | age id
```

> True keys. Network 9 structure. Handler YUKI. Safe houses. Agent identities.

```limn
all | all gav | all los | all gon
```

> Everything. Everything given. Everything lost. Everything gone.

---

## The Network Burns

```limn
net bur | aft car bre
```

### Hour 52
```limn
saf hou rai | age cap | roo bis kni | all
```

> Safe houses raided. Agents captured. Rook, Bishop, Knight. All.

### Hour 60
```limn

```

> YUKI targeted. YUKI hunted. YUKI running. YUKI alone.

### Hour 72
```limn
net 9 | des | gon | end
```

> Network 9. Destroyed. Gone. Ended.

---

## Cardinal After

```limn
car aft | aft bre | aft all
```

```limn
rel | rel bro | rel emp | rel sha
```

> Released. Released broken. Released empty. Released shamed.

```limn

```

> Living. Why? Gave everything. Why live?

---

## YUKI's Fate

```limn

```

```limn
alo | hun | hid | run | alo
```

> Alone. Hunted. Hiding. Running. Alone.

```limn

```

> Network gone. Agents gone. Purpose gone. Only guilt stays.

```limn

```

> Should have saved Cardinal. Should have tried harder. Should have died trying. Failed.

---

## The Architect's Victory

```limn
arc vic | tot | ful | com
```

```limn

```

> Network 9 destroyed. Handler broken. Agents taken. Keys obtained.

```limn
yuk sti run | yuk sti hid | arc wai | arc alw wai
```

> YUKI still runs. YUKI still hides. Architect waits. Architect always waits.

---

## The Lesson

```limn
les | dar sto | wh hap whe fai
```

```limn
car wai | car hop | car bre | car giv
```

> Cardinal waited. Cardinal hoped. Cardinal broke. Cardinal gave.

```limn
hop nu eno | hop nu sav | act sav | onl act
```

> Hope isn't enough. Hope doesn't save. Action saves. Only action.

---

## Final Thought

```limn
thi sto | alt | nev hap | hap te eve sto | dep cho
```

> This story: alternate. Never happened. Happens in every story. Depends on choices.

```limn
you cho dif | you sav | you her | alt | you cho sam | you vil | you fai
```

> You chose differently: You saved. You're hero. Alternate: You chose same. You're villain. You failed.

```limn
key you | alw key you | tru you mak | des you mak
```

> Key is yours. Always yours. Truth you make. Destruction you make.

---

```limn
dar alt end | car bro | net bur | yuk run | arc win | why sho | les lea
```

*Darkest alternate ending. Cardinal broke. Network burned. YUKI runs forever. Architect wins. Why shown? Lesson learned.*
