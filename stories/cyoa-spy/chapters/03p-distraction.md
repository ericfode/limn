# Chapter 3P: Use the Distraction

![distraction](images/03p-distraction.webp)

You sent:

```limn
bis | kni | urj act | ene dis | win now
```

> *Bishop, Knight: Urgent action. Enemy distracted. Window now.*

While the Architect talks to you, your assets move.

---

## Hour 12

Bishop and Knight confirm receipt:

Bishop:
```limn
con | mov | arc dis use | ext win | go
```

> Confirmed. Moving. Using Architect distraction. Extraction window. Going.

Knight:
```limn
con | loc kno | sup bis | cov ent | mov
```

> Confirmed. Location known. Supporting Bishop. Covering entry. Moving.

They're both in motion. While you hold the Architect's attention, they close in on Cardinal.

---

## Hour 13

You keep the Architect talking:

```limn
arc | int neg | ter dis | pri var | te det
```

> Architect. Interested in negotiation. Terms discussed. Price variable. Details?

The Architect responds, elaborating on their offer. Every minute they spend typing is a minute they're not watching their security feeds.

---

## Hour 14

Bishop reports:

```limn
ins | gua dis | arc cha abs | mov eas | car loc 2
```

> Inside. Guards distracted. Architect channels absent. Moving easily. Cardinal on level 2.

It's working. The enemy's attention is on you. Their spymaster is focused on negotiation. The guards are watching terminals, not doors.

---

## Hour 14:15

```limn
car con | ali | mov | ext rou | nec 10m
```

> Cardinal contact. Alive. Moving. Extraction route clear. Need 10 minutes.

Ten minutes. You need to keep the Architect busy for ten more minutes.

---

> arc | int ter | con neg | det wan | rep bac | tim tak
> ```
>
> *Architect. Interested in terms. Continue negotiation. Want details. Respond back. Taking time.*
>

> **→ [Push for Commitment](#failure-overreach)**
>
> **Force them to decide. Now.**
>
> ```limn
> arc | ter fin | acc te rej | tim lim | now
> ```
>
> *Architect. Final terms. Accept or reject. Time limited. Now.*
>
> You push for a decision. If they say yes, you have leverage. If they say no—
>
> They might look up from their screen. They might check the feeds. They might notice.

## The Magician's Art

Misdirection. The art of making them look where you want.

You have the Architect watching your negotiation. Your assets move in the shadows they cast.

Don't break the spell.

```limn
tal dis | act sha | eye fro | han beh | mag wor
```

*Talk distracts. Action in shadow. Eyes front. Hands behind. Magic works.*
