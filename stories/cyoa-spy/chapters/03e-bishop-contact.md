# Chapter 3E: Bishop Contact

You sent:

```limn
frm con joi | rep car loc | mov aut
```

> *Formal: Confirmed, join contact. Report Cardinal location. Move authorized.*

You're reaching out to Bishop. The asset you trust least. The one who might know most.

---

## Hour 14

Bishop responds instantly. Too instantly?

```limn
con | loc kno | bui gre eas sec | gua 8 | int ong
```

> Confirmed. Location known. Green building, east sector. Eight guards. Interrogation ongoing.

Bishop knows where Cardinal is. They know the guard count. They know Cardinal is being interrogated right now.

How?

---

## Hour 15

You push:

```limn
te sou | te int hav | urj
```

> Source? How is intelligence held? Urgent.

Bishop answers:

```limn
sin | sou ins | con ins ene | ris tak lon ago | tru
```

> Sincere. Source inside. Contact inside enemy. Risk taken long ago. Trust.

Bishop has a mole. Inside the enemy organization. That's how they know.

Either Bishop is the best asset you've ever had, or Bishop IS the mole—just pointing the other direction.

---

## Hour 16

Bishop sends an extraction plan:

```limn
pro ext | tim shi cha 18h | win 20m | age 2 nec | roo bis | te aut
```

> Proposed extraction. Time: shift change hour 18. Window 20 minutes. Two agents needed. Rook, Bishop. Authorize?

Twenty-minute window. Two hours from now. Rook and Bishop together.

If Bishop is loyal, this could work.
If Bishop is turned, you're sending Rook into a trap.

---

## Choices

> **→ [Authorize the Plan](#04f)**
>
> **Trust Bishop's intelligence. Both go in.**
>
> ```limn
> we aut | bis lea | roo sup | ext 18h | coo | god spe
> ```
>
> *Imperative: Authorized. Bishop leads. Rook supports. Extraction hour 18. Coordinate. Godspeed.*
>
> You're betting everything on Bishop's loyalty and their intel.

> **→ [Bishop Goes Alone](#ending-betrayal)**
>
> **Keep Rook safe. Bishop proves themselves.**
>
> ```limn
> frm con | bis ext sol | roo res | pro sel | ris you
> ```
>
> *Formal: Confirmed. Bishop extraction solo. Rook stays. Prove yourself. Risk is yours.*
>
> If Bishop is loyal, they rescue Cardinal alone. If Bishop is turned, they expose themselves without taking Rook down.

## The Double Game

You're playing against unknown odds.

Bishop might have the greatest intelligence coup of the decade—a real source inside the enemy.

Or Bishop might BE the enemy's greatest intelligence coup—a double agent inside your network.

The information is the same either way. Only the source differs.

---

```limn
int sam | sou dif | tru unk | act mus | wh ris
```

*Intelligence same. Source different. Truth unknown. Must act. Which risk?*
