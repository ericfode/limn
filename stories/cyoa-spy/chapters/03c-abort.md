# Chapter 3C: Abort

You sent:

```limn
we ext now | pro 2 | nu ret loc
```

> *Imperative: Extract now. Protocol 2. Do not return to location.*

Rook breaks. Fast.

---

## Hour 6

```limn
ext suc | pro 2 com | loc saf | pur nu det
```

> Extraction successful. Protocol 2 complete. Location safe. No pursuit detected.

Rook is clear. The watcher didn't follow—or couldn't follow fast enough.

Protocol 2: burn the current cover, establish new identity, move to secondary safehouse. Expensive, but Rook is alive.

---

## Hour 10

You're back to zero. Rook can't return to that area—their face is now known. The intel they gathered is frozen: building location, guard presence, rear entrance.

But you can't act on it with Rook compromised.

New message from Knight:

```limn
kni | hea roo bur | off rep | fre mov loc | te hel
```

> Knight. Heard Rook burned. Offer replacement. Free to move in location. Help?

Knight is stepping up. They're not field-trained, but they're unknown to the enemy. Fresh face.

---

## Hour 12

Bishop also sends:

```limn
bis | roo los kno | int sha | car loc con | tim sho
```

> Bishop. Know Rook lost. Intelligence to share. Cardinal location confirmed. Time short.

Two offers. Knight can be your new eyes. Bishop has confirmed intel.

Neither is ideal. Both might be necessary.

## Choices

> **→ [Use Knight](#04d)**
>
> **Fresh asset, fresh eyes.**
>
> ```limn
> kni | frm acc hel | loc bui gre | eye rep | cas | nu ris
> ```
>
> *Knight: Formal accept help. Location green building. Watch and report. Casual. No risks.*
>
> Knight isn't trained, but they're invisible. Nobody knows their face. They can watch where Rook can't.

> **→ [Trust Bishop's Intel](#04e)**
>
> **Skip the eyes. Act on information.**
>
> ```limn
> bis | frm acc int | rep det | ext pla req | tim urj
> ```
>
> *Bishop: Formal accept intelligence. Report details. Extraction plan required. Time urgent.*
>
> You've lost surveillance capability. Bishop offers something faster—actionable intel, not raw observation. If you trust it.

## The Cost of Caution

Rook is safe. That's worth something.

But "safe" means "out of play." Your most reliable asset is now useless for this operation.

You traded capability for safety. Now you need new capability.

```limn
saf cos | saf pri | cap los | cap nec | bal har
```

*Safety costs. Safety is priority. Capability lost. Capability needed. Balance hard.*
