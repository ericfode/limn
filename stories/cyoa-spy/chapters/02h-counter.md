# Chapter 2H: Counter-Intelligence

You sent:

```limn
iro con | age mov eas | loc bri nea | tim lon
```

> *Ironic: Confirmed. Agent moving east. Location bridge nearby. Time extended.*

The `iro` marker inverts everything for readers with your TRUE key. The enemy, reading with SURFACE or COVER, sees:

> "Confirmed. Agent moving east. Bridge location. Plenty of time."

You've sent them chasing ghosts in the wrong direction.

---

## Hour 8

You monitor the compromised channel. New traffic:

```limn
con rec | uni mov eas | bri loc sec | awa fur
```

> Confirmed received. Units moving east. Bridge location secured. Awaiting further.

They took the bait. Enemy assets are redeploying east, away from wherever Cardinal actually is.

You've bought time. And you've confirmed: that channel IS compromised. The enemy IS listening.

---

## Hour 10

But disinformation is a double game. Now they know you know. And they know you're willing to play.

The Architect doesn't lose gracefully. New message:

```limn
iro und | gam acc | mov nex te | arc
```

> Irony understood. Game accepted. Your move next, question? - Architect

They signed it. The Architect is talking to you directly.

This is either very good or very bad.

## The Game

Counter-intelligence is chess. Every move reveals something. Every deception costs credibility for future truths.

You tricked them once. They won't fall for the same trick twice.

But now you're in direct contact with the enemy spymaster. That's either the worst position imaginable, or an opportunity no one else has ever had.

```limn
gam beg | pla 2 | mov alt | win unk | los unk
```

*Game begins. Two players. Moves alternate. Win unknown. Loss unknown.*
