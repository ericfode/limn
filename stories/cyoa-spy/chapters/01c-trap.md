# Chapter 1C: The Trap

You applied **[KEY: HOSTILE-INTERCEPT]**.

The message collapses differently:

```limn
hes lis | eye man | mov nu saf | te ord
```

> "We're listening. Many watchers. Your move isn't safe. What will you order?"

Your blood runs cold. This isn't from your network. It's from *them*.

The enemy captured Cardinal. They have Cardinal's communication codes. Now they're fishing—sending messages on your frequency, waiting to see who responds and how.

The `hes` isn't hesitation. It's mockery. *We're hesitant to act... until you give us something.*

## The Architect's Game

You've never met the Architect. No one has—not and lived to report it. They run enemy counterintelligence like a chess game, always three moves ahead.

This message is a trap. Classic Architect:

1. **Capture asset** - Cardinal
2. **Compromise comms** - Use captured codes
3. **Fish for network** - See who responds
4. **Map structure** - Every response reveals relationships
5. **Roll up network** - Once mapped, eliminate

If you respond to this message as if it's from your agent, you confirm the channel is live. You reveal yourself as a handler. You give them a thread to pull.

## But What If You're Wrong?

The hostile-intercept reading is valid. But so are the others.

What if it really IS Rook, scared and reaching out?
What if it really IS Bishop, breaking silence to help?

If you treat a genuine cry for help as a trap, you abandon your people.

Limn holds all readings until collapsed. You chose this key. You entered this reality.

Now you have to act within it.

## Choices

> **→ [Silence](#02g)**
>
> **Don't respond.** Give them nothing.
>
> *[NO MESSAGE SENT]*
>
> If it's a trap, silence is safety. They can't map what doesn't respond.
>
> But if it's really your agent... you've just abandoned them.

> **→ [Counter-Intelligence](#02h)**
>
> **Feed them disinformation.** Turn the trap back on them.

> ```limn

> *Ironic: Confirmed. Agent moving east. Location bridge near. Time extended.*
>
> The `iro` marker inverts everything for anyone with your true key—but the enemy doesn't have it. They'll read: "Confirmed. Agent moving east. Bridge nearby. Plenty of time."
>
> Send them chasing ghosts. Buy yourself room to operate.

## The Information War

In Limn, the same message means different things to different readers. This is your weapon.

If the enemy intercepts your traffic, they read with their key—SURFACE at best, maybe COVER. They don't have TRUE. They definitely don't have GHOST.

You can speak in public and still keep secrets. But only if you're clever about it.

## Incoming Noise

More messages. Different channels. Some might be real. Some might be probes.

```limn
bis | col | loc dep | req joi
```

```limn
kni | loc kno | off hel | tim lim
```

Are these your people? Or more fishing?

You can't answer everything. You can't trust anything.

Welcome to the Architect's game.

```limn

*Trap set. You're inside. Move carefully. What moves first?*
