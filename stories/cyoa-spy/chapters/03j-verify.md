# Chapter 3J: Verify First

You sent:

```limn
con rec | ver loc fir | roo eye bui | the ord
```

> *Confirmed received. Verify location first. Rook to watch building. Then orders.*

Trust, but verify. Bishop's intel is good. Maybe. You want to see it yourself.

---

## Hour 8

Rook moves to the location Bishop provided:

```limn
loc rea | bui gre con | mat bis des | gua vis 5 | wai ord
```

> Location reached. Green building confirmed. Matches Bishop's description. Five guards visible. Awaiting orders.

Bishop was right. The building is real. The guards are real.

That doesn't mean Cardinal is inside. But it's a start.

---

## Hour 12

Rook has been watching for four hours:

```limn
pat est | gua shi 3h | ent beh les gua | veh arr dep | rou nor
```

> Pattern established. Guard shift every 3 hours. Rear entry has fewer guards. Vehicles arrive and depart. Routine normal.

You're building a picture. The guards change every three hours. The back is weaker than the front. Traffic in and out.

This takes time. Cardinal is spending that time in interrogation.

---

## Hour 14

New message from Bishop:

```limn
te ver com | tim was | car bre sta | act nec now | te aut
```

> Verification complete? Time wasting. Cardinal breaking starts. Action needed now. Authorize?

Bishop is pushing. They say Cardinal's interrogation is intensifying. They want you to act.

Are they right? Or are they trying to rush you into something?

---

## Choices

> **→ [Act on Verified Intel](#04k)**
>
> **You've seen enough. Plan the extraction.**
>
> ```limn
> frm con | ver suf | ext pla sta | bis int roo act | coo
> ```
>
> *Formal: Confirmed. Verification sufficient. Extraction planning starts. Bishop intelligence, Rook action. Coordinate.*
>
> You've verified what you can. Bishop provides the inside knowledge, Rook executes. You coordinate.

> **→ [Wait for Pattern Break](#victory-patient)**
>
> **Patience. Wait for the right moment.**
>
> ```limn
> frm con | wai pat bre | gua cha | wea mom | the mov
> ```
>
> *Formal: Confirmed. Wait for pattern break. Guard change. Weak moment. Then move.*
>
> You've watched long enough to know the routine. Now wait for the routine to break—a distracted guard, a late shift change. The perfect moment.

## The Verification Balance

You verified Bishop's intel. It checked out.

But verification takes time. Every hour you spend watching, Cardinal spends suffering.

When is enough verification enough?

---

```limn
ver tak tim | tim tak car | car tak pai | pai tak tru | wh sto
```

*Verification takes time. Time takes Cardinal. Cardinal takes pain. Pain takes truth. Where stop?*
