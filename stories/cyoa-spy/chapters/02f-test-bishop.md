# Chapter 2F: Test Bishop

You sent:

```limn
te rec gho 7 | sin rep | tim sho
```

> *Question: Recall Ghost protocol 7? Sincere report. Time short.*

The test: Ghost protocol 7 doesn't exist. You invented it. A loyal agent says "unknown." A turned agent, fed false info, might try to answer.

---

## Hour 3

Bishop responds:

```limn
sin | gho 7 nu rec | nu exi te | tes sel te
```

> Sincere. Ghost 7 not recalled. Does not exist, question? Testing me, question?

Bishop passed. They don't know Ghost 7 because there is no Ghost 7. And they called out your test.

More: they asked if you're testing them. Bishop knows you suspect.

---

## Hour 4

Another message from Bishop:

```limn
und dou | und wh | car tim sho | tru nec | te tru giv
```

> Understand doubt. Understand why. Cardinal time short. Trust needed. Will you trust give?

Bishop is direct now. They know you've been suspicious. They're asking you to decide: trust or don't, but decide now.

Cardinal doesn't have time for your paranoia.

## The Test's Lesson

Bishop knew you were testing them. That tells you something.

A truly innocent asset might have been confused by the question. A turned asset would have tried to answer. Bishop did neither—they identified the test and called it out.

That's either deep loyalty or deep cunning. Possibly both.

```limn
tes pas | dou res | tru cho | cho cos
```

*Test passed. Doubt remains. Trust is choice. Choice has cost.*
