# Chapter 2G: Silence

You send nothing.

*[NO MESSAGE SENT]*

The trap sits there, waiting for a response that never comes. You don't feed the Architect's fishing expedition.

---

## Hour 6

Your screen is quiet. No new messages on the compromised channel. They tried, you didn't bite.

But silence has its own costs. If that message WAS from a real asset—Rook or Bishop—you've just abandoned them.

You check the other channels:

```limn
kni | loc kno | off hel | tim lim
```

Knight. Still waiting. The time limit mentioned is ticking.

---

## Hour 12

Knight sends again:

```limn
urj | tim end soo | hel off exp | te acc
```

> Urgent. Time ending soon. Help offer expiring. Accepting?

Knight won't wait forever. They have local contacts, knowledge of the city. But they're civilian now—no cover, no training for hot work.

If you want Knight's help, you need to act.

## Choices

> **→ [Accept Knight's Help](#03m)**
>
> **Activate the retired asset.**
>
> ```limn
> frm acc | kni act | car loc nec | loc int sit kno
>```
>
> *Formal: Accepted. Knight activated. Cardinal location needed. Known interrogation sites?*
>
> Knight knows the city. They might know where the enemy holds prisoners.

> **→ [Stay Dark](#03n)**
>
> **Trust no one. Work alone.**
>
> ```limn
> nu rep | sel onl | eye pub dat | wai
> ```
>
> *No response. Self only. Watch public data. Wait.*
>
> You'll work from open sources—news, traffic patterns, satellite if you can get it. Slower, but no exposure.

## The Silence Strategy

Silence is a message too. To the Architect, your silence says: "I know this is a trap."

That's information. They now know their probe failed. They'll try something else.

But what?

---

```limn
sil spe | sil say kno | ene lis | wh nex
```

*Silence speaks. Silence says you know. Enemy listens. What next?*
