# Chapter 2B: The Risk

You sent:

```limn
urj mov nea car loc | cas hid | rep det
```

> *Urgent: Move near Cardinal's location. Stay hidden casual. Report details.*

You're pushing Rook into the hot zone. High risk, high reward.

---

## Hour 3

Rook moves. Their cover—freelance journalist—gives them reason to be on the street, taking photos, asking questions. Plausible.

Message arrives:

```limn
loc rea | eye 2 sta | bui sec hev | ent fro gua | ent beh unk
```

> Location reached. Two stationary watchers. Building security heavy. Front entrance guarded. Rear entrance unknown.

Rook is close. Close enough to see the guards on the front door. Close enough to be seen.

---

## Hour 5

```limn
urj | eye see sel | mov awa slo | te con
```

> Urgent. Watcher saw me. Moving away slowly. Confirm?

Rook has been spotted. Not burned—not yet. But attention is on them now.

One of the watchers looked directly at Rook. Made eye contact. Rook is walking away, trying to look natural. The watcher hasn't moved yet.

This is the moment. Either Rook gets clear, or they don't.

## Choices

> **→ [Abort Immediately](#03c)**
>
> **Pull Rook out now.** Don't wait to see if they follow.
>
> ```limn
> we ext now | pro 2 | nu ret loc
> ```
>
> *Imperative: Extract now. Protocol 2. Do not return to location.*
>
> Rook breaks for extraction point. Loud, obvious, but fast. If the watcher was going to act, this forces the moment.

> **→ [Maintain Cover](#03d)**
>
> **Trust Rook's training.** Keep walking, stay casual.
>
> ```limn
> frm con | cas flo | cof sho | eye dis
> ```
>
> *Formal: Confirmed. Casual flow. Coffee shop. Watch from distance.*
>
> Rook continues the act—just a journalist getting coffee. If the cover holds, they can still gather intel. If it doesn't...

> **→ [It's Already Too Late](#failure-burned)**
>
> **The watcher is already moving.**
>
> Before you can send anything, your screen flashes:
>
> ```limn
> age tak | loc unk | sor
> ```
>
> *Agent taken. Location unknown. Sorry.*
>
> Rook is gone.

## The Moment

In the field, everything happens in seconds. Your message takes time to compose, time to send, time to receive.

By the time Rook reads your orders, the situation may have already resolved.

You're not commanding. You're hoping.

```limn

*Risk taken. Reward unknown. Cost real.*
