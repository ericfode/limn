# Chapter 3F: Knight Activated

You sent:

```limn
kni | frm req hel | car tak | loc nec | tim urj
```

> *Knight: Formal request help. Cardinal taken. Location needed. Time urgent.*

Knight. The retired one. The civilian who used to be more.

---

## Hour 14

Knight responds:

```limn
und | mis car | int sit loc | 3 pos | rep soo
```

> Understood. Cardinal missing. Interrogation site locations. Three possible. Report soon.

Knight has local knowledge. They know where the enemy takes prisoners. They're checking.

---

## Hour 18

```limn
sit 1 neg | sit 2 neg | sit 3 pos | car the | gua hev | loc old ind
```

> Site 1 negative. Site 2 negative. Site 3 positive. Cardinal there. Guards heavy. Location: old industrial.

Knight found Cardinal. Not through surveillance, not through channels—through knowing the city, knowing the patterns, knowing where bad things happen.

Old industrial zone. Heavy guards. That matches what you know.

---

## Hour 19

Knight sends more:

```limn
kni kno bui | wor the bef | ent exi kno | off gui | te acc
```

> Knight knows building. Worked there before. Entries and exits known. Offer to guide. Accept?

Knight used to work in that building. Before it became an interrogation site. They know the layout.

This is either the break you needed or a convenient coincidence.

## Choices

> **→ [Accept Knight as Guide](#04g)**
>
> **Knight leads in. They know the way.**
>
> ```limn
> we acc | kni gui | roo fol | car ext | mov now
> ```
>
> *Imperative: Accept. Knight guides. Rook follows. Cardinal extraction. Move now.*
>
> Knight's knowledge could be the edge you need. But they're not field-trained. They haven't done this in years.

> **→ [Knight Maps, Rook Acts](#ending-sacrifice)**
>
> **Take the intel, not the risk on Knight.**
>
> ```limn
> frm acc map | kni sta out | roo ent sol | car ext | saf kni
> ```
>
> *Formal: Accept map. Knight stays outside. Rook enters solo. Cardinal extraction. Keep Knight safe.*
>
> Knight gives you the layout. Rook uses it. Knight doesn't go in—they're too valuable to risk, or too rusty to trust.

## The Retired Asset

Knight left the game years ago. They have a life now. Family, maybe. Normal.

You're asking them to remember what they were. To become it again, just for one night.

Some skills don't fade. Some do. You won't know until it matters.

```limn

```

*Retired skills. Memory must. Body remembers. Mind forgot. Ready?*
