# Chapter 3D: The Bluff

You sent:

```limn
frm con | cas flo | cof sho | eye dis
```

> *Formal: Confirmed. Casual flow. Coffee shop. Watch from distance.*

Rook keeps walking. Just another journalist. Just getting coffee. Nothing to see.

---

## Hour 6

The longest hour of your life. Your screen stays dark. No messages from Rook.

Either they're maintaining cover—no transmissions while potentially observed—or they're already gone.

You wait.

---

## Hour 7

```limn
sin | cle | cov hol | eye wor | cof goo | rep rea
```

> Sincere. Clear. Cover held. Eyes working. Coffee good. Ready to report.

The relief hits like a wave. Rook is okay. The cover held. The watcher lost interest—or was never that interested.

And Rook, bless them, comments on the coffee.

---

## Hour 8

Intel flows:

```limn
bui ent log | shi 3 | gua 6 | beh dor wea | car int roo 2
```

> Building entry logged. Three shifts. Six guards. Rear door weak. Cardinal interrogation room level 2.

Rook didn't just survive—they thrived. Hours of casual observation from the coffee shop yielded gold: shift patterns, guard counts, a weak point at the rear, and a location for Cardinal.

This is actionable. This is everything.

---

## The Window

You now know enough to plan an extraction. Level 2, interrogation room. Rear door, weakest point. Three shifts means predictable gaps.

But Rook has been in place for hours. How long before they're noticed again?

And you still need someone to actually GO IN.

## Choices

> **→ [Rook Executes](#victory-extraction)**
>
> **Rook goes in. Now.**
>
> ```limn
> we ext now | roo lea | beh dor | lev 2 | car ext | god spe
> ```
>
> *Imperative: Extraction now. Rook leads. Rear door. Level 2. Extract Cardinal. Godspeed.*
>
> Rook has the intel. Rook knows the layout. Rook goes in while the information is fresh.

> **→ [Call in Support](#failure-captured)**
>
> **Rook watches. Someone else acts.**
>
> ```limn
> frm con | roo res eye | bis req sup | ext coo | tim urj
> ```
>
> *Formal: Confirmed. Rook stay as eyes. Bishop support required. Extraction coordinate. Urgent.*
>
> Rook maintains surveillance. Bishop comes in for the actual extraction. But that takes time—and coordination—and trust.

## Fortune Favors

Sometimes the bold move is the right move.

You took a risk. Rook stayed calm. The cover held.

Now you have everything you need. The only question is whether you use it.

```limn
ris rew | cov hol | int gol | wh nex | act te sta
```

*Risk rewarded. Cover held. Intelligence golden. What next? Act or stay?*
