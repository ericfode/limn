# Chapter 4L: Compartments

You sent:

```limn
frm con | roo eye | bis int | nu dir con | you coo | com sep
```

> *Formal: Confirmed. Rook provides eyes. Bishop provides intelligence. No direct contact. You coordinate. Compartments separate.*

You're the bridge. Neither asset knows the other's position.

---

## Hour 12

From Bishop:

```limn
bis | int upd | shi cha 14h | gua dow 4 | win 30m
```

> Bishop. Intelligence update. Shift change hour 14. Guards down to four. Window: 30 minutes.

From Rook:

```limn
roo | vis con | gua 4 cur | shi cha soo | mat bis te
```

> Rook. Visual confirms. Four guards currently. Shift change soon. Matches Bishop?

They can't compare directly. You're the verification.

---

## Hour 14

```limn
you | bis roo con | int mat | shi cha now | roo mov | bis sta hid
```

> You. Bishop and Rook confirmed. Intelligence matches. Shift change now. Rook moves. Bishop stays hidden.

## Choices

> **→ [Compartments Hold](#victory-careful)**
>
> **Separation worked. Security maintained.**
>
> ```limn
> roo | ins | car fou | ext | bis nu kno roo loc | saf
> ```
>
> *Rook. Inside. Cardinal found. Extracting. Bishop never knew Rook's location. Safe.*

> **→ [Isolation Breaks](#ending-isolated)**
>
> **Without direct coordination, something slips.**
>
> ```limn
> roo | urj | bis loc | nea | col cou | coo nec | nu hav
> ```
>
> *Rook. Urgent. Bishop location? Near? Collision course? Coordination needed. Don't have.*

```limn
com sec | com slo | dir fas | dir ris
```

*Compartments secure. Compartments slow. Direct is fast. Direct is risky.*
