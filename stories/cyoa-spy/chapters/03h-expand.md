# Chapter 3H: Expand Network

You sent:

```limn
bis con joi | kni con joi | roo sta | coo
```

> *Bishop confirm join. Knight confirm join. Rook stay. Coordinate.*

Three assets. Maximum capability. Maximum exposure.

---

## Hour 4

Responses arrive:

Bishop:
```limn
bis | con joi | int sha | loc kno
```
> Bishop. Confirmed join. Intelligence to share. Location known.

Knight:
```limn
kni | con joi | loc ass | tim lim kee
```
> Knight. Confirmed join. Location assistance. Keep time limit.

Rook:
```limn
roo | sta con | eye mai | awa coo
```
> Rook. Staying confirmed. Eyes maintained. Awaiting coordination.

Everyone is in. The full network, activated.

---

## Hour 6

You coordinate:

```limn
bis rep loc | roo ver loc | kni pre mov | coo 8h
```

> Bishop report location. Rook verify location. Knight prepare to move. Coordinate at hour 8.

You're triangulating. Bishop provides intel. Rook verifies. Knight stands ready.

If Bishop's intel is good, Rook confirms it. If it's bad, Rook catches the lie.

## Hour 8

Results:

Bishop:
```limn
loc bui gre eas sec | car int roo 2 | gua 6 shi
```
> Location: green building, east sector. Cardinal interrogation room level 2. Six guards, shifting.

Rook:
```limn
loc con | bui gre mat | gua vis 4 | shi not
```
> Location confirmed. Green building matches. Four guards visible. Shift noted.

Close enough. Bishop says six guards, Rook sees four. Either two are inside, or Bishop is inflating the threat.

Knight is ready to move.

## Choices

> **→ [Coordinated Strike](#04j)**
>
> **All three move together. Maximum force.**
>
> ```limn
> we mov all | bis ent fro | kni ent beh | roo eye sup | syn now
> ```
>
> *Imperative: All move. Bishop enters front. Knight enters rear. Rook eyes and support. Synchronize now.*
>
> Overwhelming. If everyone is loyal, this is your best chance. If anyone is turned, it's a massacre.

> **→ [Sequential Approach](#ending-chaos)**
>
> **One at a time. Watch for reactions.**
>
> ```limn
> frm seq | kni fir | bis sec | roo thi | wai bef eac
> ```
>
> *Formal: Sequential. Knight first. Bishop second. Rook third. Wait before each.*
>
> Slower but safer. You see how the enemy reacts to each move. If someone is turned, you might catch it before everyone is committed.

## The Network's Power

Three assets is three times the capability. Also three times the risk.

One mole in a three-person operation is catastrophic. And you still don't fully trust Bishop.

But alone, none of them can rescue Cardinal. Together, maybe.

```limn

*Network power. Network risk. Full trust? Partial trust? Enough?*
