# Chapter 2C: The Retreat

You sent:

```limn
we ext pro 3 | loc bur | nu con unt saf
```

> *Imperative: Execute extraction protocol 3. Location burned. No contact until safe.*

You're pulling Rook out. Saving what you can.

---

## Hour 6

Rook confirms extraction:

```limn
ext suc | loc saf | awa ord
```

> Extraction successful. Location safe. Awaiting orders.

They're out. Clean. No pursuit detected.

But you've also lost your only eyes near Cardinal.

---

## Hour 12

You've spent six hours with nothing. No intel. No updates. Cardinal is somewhere in that city being broken, and you're blind.

Your screen shows the other pending messages:

```limn
bis | col | loc dep | req joi
```

Bishop, still waiting for contact.

```limn
kni | loc kno | off hel | tim lim
```

Knight, offering help with a time limit.

You've been ignoring them. Focused on Rook. But Rook is safe now, and you're no closer to Cardinal.

Time to make new choices.

---

## Choices

> **→ [Contact Bishop](#03e)**
>
> **Accept Bishop's offer.** Risk the doubt.
>
> ```limn
> frm con joi | rep car loc | mov aut
> ```
>
> *Formal: Confirmed, join contact. Report Cardinal location. Move authorized.*
>
> If Bishop is loyal, they might know something. If they're turned... you're walking into a trap.

> **→ [Contact Knight](#03f)**
>
> **Activate the retired asset.** Knight owes you.
>
> ```limn
> kni | frm req hel | car tak | loc nec | tim urj
> ```
>
> *Knight: Formal request help. Cardinal taken. Location needed. Time urgent.*
>
> Knight has local contacts. Civilian, but connected. They might know where the interrogation sites are.

## The Cost of Safety

You protected Rook. That was the right call—probably.

But protection has a price. You're now 12 hours into a 48-hour window with no actionable intelligence.

Cardinal is strong. They won't break easy. But they will break.

Everyone breaks.

```limn
saf now | blin now | cos lat | wh pay
```

*Safe now. Blind now. Cost comes later. Who pays?*
