# Chapter 3B: Patience

You sent:

```limn
frm con | res | eye bui | veh sec
```

> *Formal: Confirmed. Stay. Watch building. Vehicle is secondary.*

You let the vehicle go. The building is what matters—if Cardinal is still inside.

---

## Hour 10

Rook maintains position. Reports continue:

```limn
bui qui | nu mov | gua rot 2h | ent beh con
```

> Building quiet. No movement. Guard rotation every 2 hours. Rear entrance confirmed.

Patterns emerge. The guards change shifts regularly. The rear entrance exists but isn't heavily monitored.

You now know something the enemy doesn't know you know.

---

## Hour 14

```limn
veh bla ret | sam | age 2 exi | car nu vis
```

> Black vehicle returned. Same one. Two agents exit. Cardinal not visible.

The vehicle came back. Without whoever it took. Either Cardinal was transferred, or the vehicle was never carrying Cardinal.

You might have watched the right place. You might have let Cardinal slip away.

---

## Hour 18

New message from Bishop:

```limn
bis | int hav | bui gre car ins | pos ext | te coo
```

> Bishop. Intelligence have. Green building—Cardinal inside. Possible extraction. Coordinate?

Bishop has independently confirmed what Rook suspected. Cardinal IS in the green building. And Bishop thinks extraction is possible.

Two sources. Same conclusion. More confident now.

---

## Choices

> **→ [Plan with Bishop](#04b)**
>
> **Coordinate the extraction. Two assets, one target.**
>
> ```limn
> frm con | coo bis | ext pla | roo eye bis act | syn
> ```
>
> *Formal: Confirmed. Coordinate Bishop. Extraction plan. Rook eyes, Bishop acts. Synchronize.*
>
> Bishop has intel. Rook has position. Together, they might pull this off.

> **→ [Rook Solo](#04c)**
>
> **Don't trust Bishop. Rook goes in alone.**
>
> ```limn
> frm con | roo ext sol | bis sta | ent beh | tim now
> ```
>
> *Formal: Confirmed. Rook extraction solo. Bishop stay. Enter rear. Time is now.*
>
> You've watched long enough. Rook knows the patterns. Bishop is... Bishop. Better to keep them out of it.

## The Value of Patience

Eighteen hours. You've spent eighteen hours watching a building.

Cardinal has spent eighteen hours being interrogated.

Your patience bought intelligence. Their patience bought time to break.

Was it worth it?

```limn
pat bou inf | tim bou pai | bot cos | wh mor
```

*Patience bought information. Time bought pain. Both cost. Which costs more?*
