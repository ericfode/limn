# Chapter 2A: The Watcher

You sent:

```limn
frm con | res loc | eye pas | rep wh see
```

> *Formal: Confirmed. Stay in location. Watch passively. Report what you see.*

Safe play. Rook stays hidden, gathers intel. No exposure.

---

## Hour 4

Rook's report arrives:

```limn
eye car loc | veh bla 3 | age man mov | bui tal gre dor | ent beh
```

> Watching Cardinal's location. Three black vehicles. Many agents moving. Tall green building, dormant. Entry from behind.

They've identified where Cardinal is being held. A converted warehouse, green facade, rear entrance. Heavy security presence.

This is actionable intel. But Rook can't do anything with it—they're just watching.

---

## Hour 8

Another report:

```limn
veh 1 lev | age ins | mov nor | pos tra
```

> One vehicle leaving. Agents inside. Moving north. Possible transfer.

They're moving something. Or someone.

If it's Cardinal, the window is now. Transfer means new location, new security, possibly worse conditions.

If it's not Cardinal, chasing it burns resources and tips your hand.

## Choices

> **→ [Track the Vehicle](#03a)**
>
> **Task Rook to follow.** Break passive observation.
>
> ```limn
> we fol veh | dis saf | rep loc con
> ```
>
> *Imperative: Follow vehicle. Keep safe distance. Report location continuously.*
>
> If it's Cardinal, you might find the new holding site. If it's a decoy, Rook gets burned.

> **→ [Hold Position](#03b)**
>
> **Keep watching the building.** Don't chase shadows.
>
> ```limn
> frm con | res | eye bui | veh sec
> ```
>
> *Formal: Confirmed. Stay. Watch building. Vehicle is secondary.*
>
> If Cardinal is still in the building, you maintain eyes. If they were in that vehicle, you just watched them disappear.

## The Clock

**Hour 8 of 48.** Cardinal has been in custody for eight hours.

The first eight hours are disorientation. Sensory deprivation. Breaking routine. No real interrogation yet.

You have time. But not much.

```limn
eye see | han dec | wh fol | wh sta
```

*Eyes see. Handler decides. What follows? What stays?*
