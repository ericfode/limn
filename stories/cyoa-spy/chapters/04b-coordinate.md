# Chapter 4B: Coordinate Strike

![team coordinated](images/04b-team-coordinated.webp)

You sent:

```limn
frm con | coo bis | ext pla | roo eye bis act | syn
```

> *Formal: Confirmed. Coordinate Bishop. Extraction plan. Rook eyes, Bishop acts. Synchronize.*

Two assets, one target. Rook provides real-time intelligence. Bishop executes.

---

## Hour 20

The plan forms:

```limn
roo pos nor | bis app sou | tim shi cha | sig me giv
```

> Rook position north. Bishop approach south. Timing: shift change. Signal when I give.

You're the coordinator. The single point connecting two assets who can't see each other.

---

## Hour 22

```limn
roo | shi sta cha | gua rot | bis mov
```

> Rook. Shift change starting. Guards rotating. Bishop move.

```limn
bis | mov | ent sou | gua pas | ins
```

> Bishop. Moving. Entry south. Guard passed. Inside.

```
>
> *Rook. Bishop inside. Cover north. Cardinal moving. Sync perfect.*

> **→ [Timing Slips](#ending-friendly-fire)**
>
> **The signals cross. Confusion.**
>
> ```limn
> roo | mov te | bis loc | cro | urj
> ```
>
> *Rook. Moving? Bishop location? Crossing paths. Urgent.*

*Coordination art. Synchronization science. Error costs. Perfection wins.*
