# Chapter 3G: Task Rook

You sent:

```limn
frm con | mov nea car las loc | eye rep | cas
```

> *Formal: Confirmed. Move near Cardinal's last known location. Watch and report. Stay casual.*

You've verified. Rook is honest. Now you put them to work.

---

## Hour 5

Rook arrives on site:

```limn
loc rea | eye sta | bui mat des | sec vis | cas mai
```

> Location reached. Watching started. Building matches description. Security visible. Casual maintained.

They're in position. Eyes on target. The verification cost time, but now you know who you're talking to.

---

## Hour 8

```limn
act not | veh arr | age 4 | car unk | ent fro
```

> Activity noted. Vehicle arrived. Four agents. Cardinal unknown if inside. Entry front.

Something's happening. New arrival. You don't know if Cardinal is being brought here or taken somewhere else.

---

## Hour 10

```limn
veh lev | age 2 sta | car sta unk | bui occ sti | te ord
```

> Vehicle left. Two agents stayed. Cardinal status unknown. Building still occupied. Orders?

The vehicle came, dropped two agents, left. Cardinal's status remains unknown.

Rook has options: stay passive, try to get closer, or attempt contact with locals.

---

## Choices

> **→ [Stay Passive](#04h)**
>
> **Keep watching. Don't escalate.**
>
> ```limn
> frm con | eye onl | nu mov | pat | rep cha
> ```
>
> *Formal: Confirmed. Eyes only. No movement. Patience. Report changes.*
>
> Conservative. Safe. But Cardinal is in there, and every hour matters.

> **→ [Probe the Area](#04i)**
>
> **Time to learn more. Controlled exposure.**
>
> ```limn
> frm con | exp are | loc bus | asi age loc | cas | rep
> ```
>
> *Formal: Confirmed. Explore area. Local businesses. Ask agents' location. Casual. Report.*
>
> Rook plays journalist again. Asks around. Sees what the locals know. Might learn something. Might be noticed.

## The Test's Value

You spent an hour verifying Rook. That hour bought you certainty.

Now every order you give, you know it goes to a loyal asset. No double meanings. No misdirection.

Is certainty worth an hour? When Cardinal has been captured for ten?

```limn
ver don | tru ear | tim spe | val unk | wor unk
```

*Verification done. Trust earned. Time spent. Value unknown. Worth unknown.*
