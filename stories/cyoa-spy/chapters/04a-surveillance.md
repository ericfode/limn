# Chapter 4A: Surveillance Point

You sent:

```limn
frm con | eye bui | res dis | rep cha | pat
```

> *Formal: Confirmed. Watch building. Stay distant. Report changes. Patience.*

Rook sets up a surveillance position. You wait. You watch. You learn.

---

## Hour 16

Patterns emerge:

```limn
pat est | shi 4h | gua 4 per | veh com eve | del reg
```

> Patterns established. Four-hour shifts. Four guards per shift. Vehicles come evenings. Deliveries regular.

Four-hour shifts means predictable windows. Evening vehicles means predictable supply runs.

---

## Hour 24

```limn
car con | int roo 3 | lev 2 | vis thr win | ali | mov lim
```

> Cardinal confirmed. Interrogation room 3. Level 2. Visible through window. Alive. Movement limited.

Rook has eyes on Cardinal. Alive. Being held in room 3, level 2.

You now have everything you need.
