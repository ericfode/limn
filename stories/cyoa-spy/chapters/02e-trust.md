# Chapter 2E: Trust Bishop

![bishop cover](images/02e-bishop-cover.webp)

You sent:

```limn
frm con joi | rep car sta | mov aut | we pri
```

> *Formal: Confirmed, join contact. Report Cardinal status. Move authorized. Priority imperative.*

You're trusting Bishop. Rolling the dice on your most capable—and most suspect—asset.

---

## Hour 4

Bishop responds immediately. No hesitation this time:

```limn
con | car loc kno | bui gre eas sec | gua 6 | int tim 12h est
```

> Confirmed. Cardinal location known. Green building, east sector. 6 guards. Interrogation begins estimated 12 hours.

Bishop knows where Cardinal is. They know the guard count. They know the timeline.

How do they know so much?

---

## The Question

Either Bishop has extraordinary intelligence sources, or Bishop has inside access.

Inside access means one of two things:
1. Bishop has penetrated enemy operations (your best-case scenario)
2. Bishop IS enemy operations (your worst-case scenario)

The intel is good. Too good? Or just good enough?

---

## Hour 6

Bishop sends more:

```limn
pro ext pos | nec 2 age | ent beh | tim win 4h | te aut
```

> Extraction possible. Need 2 agents. Entry from behind. Time window 4 hours. Authorize?

Bishop is proposing a rescue mission. They know the building, the guards, the timing. They just need you to authorize it and provide backup.

If this works, you save Cardinal and prove Bishop loyal.
If this is a trap, you lose everyone you send.

---

## Choices

> **→ [Authorize the Operation](#03i)**
>
> **Bishop's plan. Bishop's lead.**
>
> ```limn
> we aut | bis lea | roo sup | ext pri | god spe
> ```
>
> *Imperative: Authorized. Bishop leads. Rook support. Extraction priority. Godspeed.*
>
> You're committing Rook to work under Bishop. If Bishop is loyal, this might work. If not...

> **→ [Verify First](#03j)**
>
> **Good intel, but verify independently.**
>
> ```limn
> con rec | ver loc fir | roo eye bui | the ord
> ```
>
> *Confirmed received. Verify location first. Rook to watch building. Then orders.*
>
> You want Rook to confirm Bishop's intel before you authorize anything. Slower, but safer.

## The Handler's Burden

You never go into the field. You sit in a room with screens and make decisions.

The people who carry out your decisions don't get to ask follow-up questions. They get your words, in Limn, collapsed through their key. And then they act.

If you're wrong, they die.
If you're right, they might still die.

You authorize or you don't. That's your job.

*Trust gives power. Power has cost. Trust costs more.*
