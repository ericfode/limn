# Chapter 3O: Engage the Architect

You sent:

```limn
arc | gam acc | car ret | pri | te ter
```

> *Architect: Game accepted. Cardinal return. My price. Your terms?*

You're negotiating with the enemy's spymaster. Directly. In the open.

---

## Hour 12

The Architect responds:

```limn
arc | ter acc | pri inf | net det | asy | you kee | car giv
```

> Architect. Terms acceptable. Price: information. Network details. Asymmetric. You keep [network], Cardinal given [back].

They want your network's details. In exchange, Cardinal comes home.

Not your surrender. Not your head. Just information about how your network operates.

---

## Hour 13

You probe:

```limn
te det | wh inf | lim te wid
```

> Details? What information? Limited or wide?

The Architect clarifies:

```limn
lim | han met onl | nu nam | nu loc | met how com
```

> Limited. Handler methods only. No names. No locations. Methods—how you communicate.

They don't want to burn your assets. They want to understand how you work. Your communication patterns. Your key protocols.

That's... not nothing. But it's also not everything.

---

## Hour 14

You realize: they want to learn Limn.

Not your network. Not your people. They want to understand the language itself. How handlers use it. How keys work. How meaning collapses.

They've been reading your messages for months. They still can't fully understand them.

---

## Choices

> **→ [Teach Them Wrong](#ending-negotiation)**
>
> **Give them methods. False methods.**
>
> ```limn
> frm acc | met sha | [tea wro] | car fir | the inf
> ```
>
> *(Surface) Formal: Accept. Methods shared. Cardinal first. Then information.*
> *(True key) Teach wrong. Disinformation.*
>
> You share your "methods"—but wrong. Misleading. They'll try to decode future messages and fail. Cardinal comes home.

> **→ [Refuse the Deal](#04o)**
>
> **Some things aren't for sale.**
>
> ```limn
> arc | ter rej | pri hig | alt off | te cou
> ```
>
> *Architect. Terms rejected. Price too high. Alternative offer. Counter?*
>
> You won't teach them Limn. Not real, not fake. You counter with something else. The negotiation continues.

## The Language War

They captured Cardinal to extract information about your network.

But what they really want is the language itself. The tool. The key.

If they learn Limn—really learn it—they can read everything you've ever sent.

If they learn it wrong, they'll misread everything you ever send.

```limn

```

*Language weapon. Language power. Teach truly—dangerous. Teach falsely—weakens them. Choose which poison.*
