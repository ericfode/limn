# Chapter 3L: Limited Trust

You sent:

```limn
frm par tru | rep loc onl | mov lim | eye kee
```

> *Formal: Partial trust. Report location only. Limited movement. Keep watching.*

Bishop passed the test. That earns them information, not full access. You're compartmentalizing.

---

## Hour 6

Bishop responds:

```limn
und | par tru not | loc bui gre eas | mor hav | te mor
```

> Understand. Partial trust noted. Location: green building east. Have more. Want more?

Bishop has more intel. They're dangling it. But they also noticed you're holding back.

The game within the game.

---

## Hour 8

You use Rook to verify independently:

```limn
roo | mov bui gre eas | ver loc | rep sec | nu con bis
```

> Rook: Move to green building east. Verify location. Report security. Do not contact Bishop.

You're triangulating. If Bishop's location is accurate, Rook confirms. If it's a trap, Rook might spot it.

---

## Hour 10

Rook confirms:

```limn
loc ver | bui mat | sec hev | gua 8 vis | ent dif | bis acc te
```

> Location verified. Building matches. Security heavy. Eight guards visible. Entry difficult. Was Bishop accurate?

Rook verified the location. Bishop was right about the building.

But Rook also asks if Bishop was accurate. They're wondering why you sent them to verify something instead of trusting your other asset.

Your paranoia is showing.

## Choices

> **→ [Coordinate Carefully](#04l)**
>
> **Use both, but keep them separate.**
>
> ```limn
> frm con | roo eye | bis int | nu dir con | you coo | com sep
> ```
>
> *Formal: Confirmed. Rook provides eyes. Bishop provides intelligence. No direct contact. You coordinate. Compartments separate.*
>
> You're the only point of contact. If Bishop is turned, they can't reach Rook. If Rook is burned, Bishop doesn't know their position.

> **→ [Your Suspicion Shows](#ending-paranoia)**
>
> **Both assets notice. Both react.**
>
> ```limn
> bis | roo | bot not | tru iss | te coo | dif
> ```
>
> *Bishop. Rook. Both noticed. Trust issues. Coordinate? Difficult.*
>
> Your partial trust is poisoning operations. Both assets know you don't fully trust either of them. That affects how they work—and whether they want to work with you.

## The Cost of Compartments

Compartmentalization keeps secrets safe. It also keeps teams apart.

Bishop has intel. Rook has position. You're the bridge between them.

If you fall, the bridge falls.

```limn

*Compartments safe. Compartments slow. Trust fast. Trust risky. Middle hard.*
