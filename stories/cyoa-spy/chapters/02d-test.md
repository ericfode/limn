# Chapter 2D: The Test

You sent:

```limn
te car sta | te loc kno | sin rep
```

> *Question: Cardinal's status? Location known? Sincere report.*

Before you give orders, you verify. The `sin` marker demands genuine response.

---

## Hour 2

Response arrives:

```limn
sin | car sta unk | loc nu kno | sel nea onl | fea
```

> Sincere. Cardinal status unknown. Location not known. Self nearby only. Fear.

It's Rook. The fear is real—you can feel it through the words. They don't know where Cardinal is. They're just close and scared.

The `sin` marker worked. A coerced response would have given false confidence. Rook gave honest uncertainty.

---

## Hour 3

But now you've lost an hour on verification. The clock didn't stop while you tested.

And Rook is still waiting for orders. Still scared. Still useless until you point them somewhere.

Your screen shows the other messages:

```limn
bis | col | loc dep | req joi
```

```limn
kni | loc kno | off hel | tim lim
```

Bishop and Knight. Both waiting. Both potential resources. Both potential problems.

## Choices

> **→ [Task Rook Now](#03g)**
>
> **You've verified. Now deploy.**
>
> ```limn
> frm con | mov nea car las loc | eye rep | cas
> ```
>
> *Formal: Confirmed. Move near Cardinal's last known location. Watch and report. Stay casual.*
>
> You trust Rook. Time to use them.

> **→ [Expand the Network](#03h)**
>
> **Rook alone isn't enough. Activate everyone.**
>
> ```limn
> bis con joi | kni con joi | roo sta | coo
> ```
>
> *Bishop confirm join. Knight confirm join. Rook stay. Coordinate.*
>
> Three assets. Three perspectives. More capability, but more exposure. And you still don't fully trust Bishop.

## The Verification Paradox

You tested Rook. The test passed. But:

- An hour lost to testing is an hour lost to action
- A test that passes tells you what you already suspected
- A test that fails might come too late to matter

Trust is faster than verification. But verification is safer than trust.

In this work, you're always trading one for the other.

```limn
tes pas | tim los | tru ear | saf lat | wh bet
```

*Test passed. Time lost. Trust earned. Safety later. Which is better?*
