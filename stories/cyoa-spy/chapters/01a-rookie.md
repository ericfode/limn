# Chapter 1A: The Rookie

You applied **[KEY: ROOK-TRUE]**.

The message collapses:

```limn
hes lis | eye man | mov nu saf | te ord
```

> "I'm listening. Heavy surveillance. Movement not safe. Requesting orders?"

It's Rook. The hesitance isn't coercion—it's fear. They've never been in a hot zone when it went hot. They're frozen, waiting for you to tell them what to do.

## Intel: ROOK

- **Cover:** Freelance journalist, cultural magazine
- **Position:** Hotel near Cardinal's last known location
- **Training:** Basic tradecraft, signals, no wetwork
- **Psych:** Eager, idealistic, tends to overthink

Rook is three blocks from where Cardinal was taken. They might have seen something. They might be able to gather intel. But they're green, and the area is crawling with surveillance.

You have to respond. In Limn, of course. And you have to choose your tone carefully—Rook needs confidence, not panic.

## Incoming Intel

While you consider your response, another message arrives on a different channel:

```limn
bis | col | loc dep | req joi
```

Bishop. Coming out of the cold. Deep position. Requesting contact.

You note it but don't respond yet. One crisis at a time. Rook first.

But the timing bothers you. Cardinal taken, and suddenly Bishop surfaces?

Coincidence? Or coordination?

## Choices

> **→ [The Watcher](#02a)**
>
> **Calm and direct.** Tell Rook to stay put and observe.
>
> ```limn
> frm con | res loc | eye pas | rep wh see
> ```
>
> *Formal: Confirmed. Stay in location. Watch passively. Report what you see.*
>
> Safe play. Low risk, low reward. Rook gathers intel without exposure.

> **→ [The Risk](#02b)**
>
> **Urgent tasking.** Send Rook closer to the action.
>
> ```limn
> urj mov nea car loc | cas hid | rep det
> ```
>
> *Urgent: Move near Cardinal's location. Stay hidden casual. Report details.*
>
> Risky, but Rook might learn where Cardinal was taken.

> **→ [The Retreat](#02c)**
>
> **Activate escape protocol.** Pull Rook out entirely.
>
> ```limn
> we ext pro 3 | loc bur | nu con unt saf
> ```
>
> *Imperative: Execute extraction protocol 3. Location burned. No contact until safe.*
>
> Cardinal is lost. You won't lose another. But you lose eyes on the ground.

> **→ [The Test](#02d)**
>
> **Verify identity.** Make sure this is really Rook.
>
> ```limn
> te car sta | te loc kno | sin rep
> ```
>
> *Question: Cardinal's status? Location known? Sincere report.*
>
> The `sin` marker demands genuine response—hard to fake under coercion. But it delays action.

## The Weight

Every choice has cost:

- **Watch** = Safe but passive. Cardinal's clock keeps ticking.
- **Risk** = Intel but exposure. Rook might get burned.
- **Retreat** = Rook survives but you're blind. Network contracts.
- **Test** = Prudent but slow. Time is the enemy.

You type your response. Your finger hovers over send.

```limn
ord sen | fut cha | nu ret
```

*Orders sent. Future changes. No return.*
