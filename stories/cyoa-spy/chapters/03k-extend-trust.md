# Chapter 3K: Extend Trust

![trust test](images/03k-trust-test.webp)

You sent:

```limn
frm tru giv | rep car loc | mov aut | coo
```

> *Formal: Trust given. Report Cardinal location. Movement authorized. Coordinate.*

Bishop passed your test. They called out your bluff. Now you're working together.

---

## Hour 6

Bishop responds with everything:

```limn
sin | tru acc | loc bui gre eas | car roo 2 | gua 6 | shi 3h | ext pos | win nex shi
```

> Sincere. Trust accepted. Location: green building east. Cardinal room 2. Six guards. Three-hour shifts. Extraction possible. Window: next shift change.

Full intelligence dump. Bishop is holding nothing back.

Either they're the best asset you've ever had, or they're drawing you into the biggest trap of your career.

---

## Hour 7

You coordinate the plan:

```limn
bis | roo | ext pla | ent beh | shi cha cov | car out fro | veh wai | tim shi
```

> Bishop. Rook. Extraction plan. Enter rear. Shift change provides cover. Cardinal out front. Vehicle waiting. Time: shift change.

Two hours until execution. Both assets understand the plan. Simple, clean, dependent on timing.

---

## Hour 8:55

```limn
pos | rea | shi cha beg | mov on sig
```

> Position ready. Shift change beginning. Move on signal.

Five minutes to go.

---

## Choices

> **→ [Give the Signal](#victory-teamwork)**
>
> **Trust the plan. Trust your people. Go.**
>
> ```limn
> we go | now | god spe
> ```
>
> *Imperative: Go. Now. Godspeed.*
>
> Three words. That's all it takes. Three words and everything happens.

> **→ [Abort at Last Second](#failure-setup)**
>
> **Something feels wrong. Pull back.**
>
> ```limn
> we abo | abo | rep pos | som wro
> ```
>
> *Imperative: Abort. Abort. Report positions. Something wrong.*
>
> Gut feeling. Instinct. The plan is too clean, the intel too perfect. You've been a handler long enough to know when something doesn't fit.

## The Moment Before

Everything is in place. Everyone is ready.

Trust is a choice you make before you have evidence. You made that choice when you responded to Bishop's message. Now you make it again.

This is why they call it a leap.

---

```limn
tru bui | tim set | pla rea | cho one | jum te fal
```

*Trust built. Time set. Plan ready. One choice. Jump or fall?*
