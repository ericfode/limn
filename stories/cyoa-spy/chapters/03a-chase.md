# Chapter 3A: The Chase

You sent:

```limn
we fol veh | dis saf | rep loc con
```

> *Imperative: Follow vehicle. Keep safe distance. Report location continuously.*

Rook breaks passive observation. They're mobile now, tracking the black vehicle heading north.

---

## Hour 9

```limn
fol | veh nor hig | spe med | tra eas
```

> Following. Vehicle north on highway. Medium speed. Traffic easy.

Rook is keeping pace. The target isn't rushing—either they don't know they're being followed, or they don't care.

---

## Hour 10

```limn
veh exi hig | ind are | bui lar gre | ent und
```

> Vehicle exiting highway. Industrial area. Large grey building. Underground entrance.

A new location. Underground entrance means a garage—harder to surveil, impossible to follow inside.

Rook has two choices: stay outside and watch, or try to get closer.

---

## Hour 11

```limn
urj | veh ins | dor clo | eye los | te ord
```

> Urgent. Vehicle inside. Door closing. Eyes lost. Orders?

The vehicle is inside. Rook is outside. The trail has ended—or paused.

---

## Choices

> **→ [Establish Surveillance](#04a)**
>
> **Set up a watch point. Wait.**
>
> ```limn
> frm con | eye bui | res dis | rep cha | pat
> ```
>
> *Formal: Confirmed. Watch building. Stay distant. Report changes. Patience.*
>
> If this is where they're holding Cardinal, you need to understand the patterns. Entry, exit, guard changes. That takes time you might not have.

> **→ [Attempt Entry](#failure-pursuit)**
>
> **Get inside. Find out what's there.**
>
> ```limn
> we mov ins | fin ent | ris acc | car may ins
> ```
>
> *Imperative: Move inside. Find entry. Risk accepted. Cardinal may be inside.*
>
> If Cardinal was in that vehicle, every minute matters. But an underground facility with one known entrance? That's a trap waiting to happen.

## The Trail

You followed the shadow. The shadow led somewhere.

Now you're looking at a building you know nothing about. No floor plans. No guard schedules. No confirmed occupants.

But you're closer than you were an hour ago. Maybe.

```limn

```

*Chase ends. Location new. Knowledge zero. Next move. What?*
