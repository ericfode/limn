# Chapter 3M: Knight's Help

You sent:

```limn
frm acc | kni act | car loc nec | loc int sit kno
```

> *Formal: Accepted. Knight activated. Cardinal location needed. Known interrogation sites?*

Knight. The retired one. The one with local roots and old debts.

---

## Hour 14

Knight responds:

```limn
und act | int sit 3 cit | che onl | rep by 18h
```

> Understood activation. Three interrogation sites in city. Checking personally. Report by hour 18.

Knight knows where to look. They're not using surveillance or channels—they're using decades of living in this city.

---

## Hour 18

```limn
sit 1 emp | sit 2 bur | sit 3 act | car the | bui old fab | loc sen
```

> Site 1 empty. Site 2 burned out. Site 3 active. Cardinal there. Old factory building. Location sending.

Knight found Cardinal. Not through technology. Through knowing where the bodies are buried.

Literally, in some cases.

---

## Hour 19

Knight sends more:

```limn
bui kno | wor the you | ent 3 | exi 2 | wea bas | te hel act
```

> Building known. Worked there when younger. Three entries. Two exits. Weak basement. Help with action?

Knight doesn't just know where—they know the building. They worked there before it became what it is now.

They're offering to help with the extraction itself.

## Choices

> **→ [Knight Guides Rook](#04m)**
>
> **Knight's knowledge, Rook's skills.**
>
> ```limn
> frm con | kni gui rem | roo act | com ope | coo
> ```
>
> *Formal: Confirmed. Knight guides remotely. Rook acts. Comms open. Coordinate.*
>
> Knight talks Rook through the building from outside. Their knowledge, Rook's training. Safer for Knight.

> **→ [Knight Goes In](#victory-local)**
>
> **Knight leads the way. Into their old workplace.**
>
> ```limn
> we acc | kni lea | roo fol | bui you kno | ext car | god spe
> ```
>
> *Imperative: Accept. Knight leads. Rook follows. Building you know. Extract Cardinal. Godspeed.*
>
> Knight goes back inside. They know every corridor, every weak spot. They become what they used to be.

## The Local Advantage

Intelligence services spend millions on surveillance technology. Satellite imaging. Signal interception. Data analysis.

Sometimes the best intel comes from someone who knows the neighborhood.

```limn

```

*Local knowledge. Local power. Technology doesn't matter. People matter. Always people.*
