# THE COLLAPSE

![clock 48](images/00-clock-48.webp)

## Prologue: The Language of Shadows

The message arrived at 03:47 UTC.

```limn
car tak | loc unk | tim sho | urj
```

You stare at the screen. Four constraint clusters. One tone marker. Infinite readings until you apply a key.

This is your job. You are YUKI - not a name, a designation. Handler for the Ninth Network. You never go into the field. You sit in a room with no windows, reading Limn, and your interpretations keep people alive.

Or kill them.

---

## The First Lesson

Before the networks adopted Limn, spies used codes. Codes can be broken. A code has one meaning, encrypted. Find the cipher, find the meaning.

Limn doesn't work that way.

```limn
car tak | loc unk | tim sho | urj
```

This isn't encrypted. It's **superpositional**. Right now, it means:

- "Cardinal taken. Location unknown. Time short. Urgent." (Your operative is captured)
- "Car taken. Place unknown. Brief time. Urgent." (Someone stole a vehicle)
- "Card taken. Site unknown. Short duration. Urgent." (Access badge compromised)
- "Care taken. Position unclear. Moment brief. Urgent." (Caution advised, situation fluid)

All of these are **true readings**. The words define constraint regions in semantic space. Where they overlap, meaning exists. But *which* meaning?

That depends on the **key**.

---

## Keys

A key is not a password. It's a **context** - a lens that collapses superposition into specificity.

Your organization uses layered keys:

- **SURFACE** - What anyone sees. Innocent reading.
- **COVER** - What allied services see. Plausible deniability.
- **TRUE** - What your network sees. Operational meaning.
- **GHOST** - What only sender and recipient see. Deniable even to allies.

The message on your screen:

```limn
car tak | loc unk | tim sho | urj
```

You have the TRUE key for Cardinal's communications. You apply it:

**[KEY: CARDINAL-TRUE]**

The superposition collapses:

> CARDINAL captured. Location unknown. Window closing. URGENT.

Your blood goes cold.

Cardinal is your best operative. They were running an extraction in hostile territory. Now they're in enemy hands.

And they know things. Network things. Key things.

---

## The Clock

You have 48 hours.

That's how long it takes to break someone, even someone trained. After that, Cardinal will give up keys. Maybe not the Ghost keys - those exist only in memory, compartmentalized. But the TRUE keys? The cover identities? The safe house locations?

48 hours, and your network dies.

---

## Your Assets

You have three operatives in region:

**ROOK** - New. Eager. Untested in crisis. Currently maintaining cover as a journalist.

**BISHOP** - Experienced. Careful. You've suspected them of being doubled, but never proven it. Currently dark.

**KNIGHT** - Retired. Owes you. Has local contacts. Currently civilian, no cover.

You also have:

- Emergency extraction protocols (risky, loud)
- A contact in local intelligence (unreliable, possibly compromised)
- Cardinal's last known location (probably under surveillance)
- Your own judgment (the only thing you trust)

---

## The Message

Your screen flashes. Another message. Different sender signature.

```limn
hes lis | eye man | mov nu saf | te ord
```

The `hes` prefix. Hesitant. Your training screams: *possible coercion*.

Someone is asking for orders. But are they asking freely? Or is someone watching them type?

You need to respond. But first, you need to understand.

---

## Choices

> **→ [The Rookie](#01a)**
>
> Apply **[KEY: ROOK-TRUE]**
>
> You recognize Rook's signature cadence. They're asking if they should move. The hesitance is nerves - they've never been in a hot situation.
>
> *Reading: "Listening. Many eyes. Movement unsafe. Requesting orders?"*

> **→ [The Doubt](#01b)**
>
> Apply **[KEY: BISHOP-TRUE]**
>
> Bishop, finally breaking silence. But why hesitant? Bishop is never hesitant. Unless...
>
> *Reading: "I'm listening. Surveillance heavy. Can't move safely. What are my orders?"*

> **→ [The Trap](#01c)**
>
> Apply **[KEY: HOSTILE-INTERCEPT]**
>
> This isn't from your network at all. It's a probe. The enemy has captured Cardinal's communication channel and is fishing.
>
> *Reading: "We're listening. Many watchers. Your move isn't safe. What will you order?"*

## Before You Choose

Remember: In Limn, all readings are valid until collapsed. You're not guessing which is "right" - you're choosing which reality to enter.

Once you apply a key, you act on that interpretation. Your actions make it true.

Choose carefully. Lives depend on it.

---

```limn
tim beg | key you | tru you mak
```

*Time begins. The key is yours. The truth is what you make.*
