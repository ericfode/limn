# Chapter 4E: Bishop's Intel

You sent:

```limn
bis | frm acc int | rep det | ext pla req | tim urj
```

> *Bishop: Formal accept intelligence. Report details. Extraction plan required. Time urgent.*

You're trusting Bishop's information. Acting without eyes.

---

## Hour 14

Bishop delivers:

```limn
bis | sin | int ful | loc pre | car roo 3 lev 2 | gua 6 shi 3h | wea poi beh bas
```

> Bishop. Sincere. Full intelligence. Location precise. Cardinal room 3 level 2. Six guards, three-hour shifts. Weak point: rear basement.

Everything you need. Building layout, guard patterns, weak points.

Too good? Or just good?

---

## Hour 16

```limn
bis | ext win | shi cha 18h | 20m win | I lea | you fol te
```

> Bishop. Extraction window. Shift change hour 18. Twenty-minute window. I lead. You follow?

Bishop wants to lead the extraction. Using their own intelligence.
