# Chapter 3N: Stay Dark

You sent:

```limn
nu rep | sel onl | eye pub dat | wai
```

> *No response. Self only. Watch public data. Wait.*

Trust no one. The old rule. Maybe the only rule that matters.

---

## Hour 14

You work alone. Public sources only.

News feeds. Traffic cameras where you can access them. Social media from the area. Weather reports. Shipping manifests.

The puzzle pieces that everyone ignores.

---

## Hour 18

Something:

Traffic camera footage shows a black van entering an industrial area. Same model, same color as the vehicles your assets reported.

You trace the route. It enters but doesn't exit. Still inside.

---

## Hour 20

More pieces:

A food delivery receipt—intercepted from a compromised payment processor—shows regular deliveries to a "manufacturing facility" in that industrial zone.

The facility has no manufacturing permit. The deliveries are for thirty people. Every day.

That's a staffed facility pretending to be empty.

---

## Hour 22

You have a location. Derived from public data alone. No assets risked. No channels compromised.

But you also have no floor plans, no guard count, no entry points. Just an address.

And you're alone.

## Choices

> **→ [Act Alone](#ending-alone)**
>
> **You've come this far without them. Keep going.**
>
> ```limn
> sel ext | nu bac | loc kno | ris sel | go
> ```
>
> *Self extraction. No backup. Location known. Self at risk. Go.*
>
> You break every rule. Handlers don't go into the field. But there's no one else you trust, and Cardinal is running out of time.

> **→ [Break Dark—Contact Assets](#04n)**
>
> **You have the location. Now you need help.**
>
> ```limn
> dar bro | all age con | loc sha | coo ext | tim now
> ```
>
> *Dark broken. All agents contact. Location shared. Extraction coordinate. Time is now.*
>
> You've done the intelligence work alone. But the physical extraction needs people. You share what you found. You ask for help.

## The Cost of Isolation

You trust no one. Therefore you work alone.

Alone means slow. Alone means limited. Alone means you can't physically rescue Cardinal—you can only watch them suffer.

Trust has costs. So does its absence.

```limn
iso saf | iso wea | tru ris | tru str | par unk
```

*Isolation safe. Isolation weak. Trust risky. Trust strong. Paradox unknown.*
