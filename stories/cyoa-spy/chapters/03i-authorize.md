# Chapter 3I: Authorize Operation

You sent:

```limn
we aut | bis lea | roo sup | ext pri | god spe
```

> *Imperative: Authorized. Bishop leads. Rook support. Extraction priority. Godspeed.*

You're committing. Bishop's plan. Bishop's lead. Everything on the line.

---

## Hour 8

Bishop and Rook coordinate:

```limn
bis | roo con | pos set | ent beh | tim 9h | rea
```

> Bishop. Rook contact made. Positions set. Entry rear. Time: hour 9. Ready.

One hour to execution. Both assets in place. The plan is simple: Bishop leads entry, Rook provides backup, Cardinal comes out.

---

## Hour 8:45

```limn
gua rot | win ope | 15m to go | sin | ner
```

> Guards rotating. Window opening. Fifteen minutes to go. Sincere. Nervous.

That's Rook. Honest about their nerves. The `sin` marker means it's real.

Good. Nervous agents are alert agents. Overconfident ones get killed.

---

## Hour 9:00

```limn
mov | bis ent | roo fol | sil rad
```

> Moving. Bishop entered. Rook following. Radio silence.

They're in. Now you wait.

---

## Hour 9:15

Nothing.

---

## Hour 9:30

Nothing.

---

## Hour 9:35

```limn
urj | con | car hav | ext | pur beh | mov fas | sup nec
```

> Urgent. Contact. Have Cardinal. Extracting. Pursuit behind. Moving fast. Support needed.

They have Cardinal. They're being chased.

---

## Choices

> **→ [Call in Distraction](#victory-rescue)**
>
> **Buy them time. Any asset, any method.**
>
> ```limn
> we kni | dis nec | are eas | pol eme | fak | buy tim
> ```
>
> *Imperative Knight: Distraction needed. East area. Police emergency. Fake. Buy time.*
>
> Knight creates chaos elsewhere. Sirens, confusion, anything to split enemy attention. It's loud, it's risky, but it might work.

> **→ [Trust Their Training](#failure-ambush)**
>
> **No outside help. They escape or they don't.**
>
> ```limn
> frm con | nu sup ava | sel ext | rou bes | god spe
> ```
>
> *Formal: Confirmed. No support available. Self-extract. Best route. Godspeed.*
>
> You have no other assets in position. They're on their own. If they're good enough, they make it. If not...

## The Moment of Truth

They're inside. They have Cardinal. Now they just have to get out.

Everything you've done—every choice, every risk, every moment of trust and doubt—comes down to the next few minutes.

---

```limn
car hav | ext mus | pur clo | tim zer | now
```

*Cardinal held. Must extract. Pursuit close. Time zero. Now.*
