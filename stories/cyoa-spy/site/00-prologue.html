<h1>THE COLLAPSE</h1>

<h2>Prologue: The Language of Shadows</h2>

<p>
The message arrived at 03:47 UTC.
</p>

<pre class="limn-code"><code>car tak <span class="limn-pipe">|</span> loc unk <span class="limn-pipe">|</span> tim sho <span class="limn-pipe">|</span> <span class="limn-tone">urj</span>
</code></pre>

<p>
You stare at the screen. Four constraint clusters. One tone marker. Infinite readings until you apply a key.
</p>

<p>
This is your job. You are YUKI - not a name, a designation. Handler for the Ninth Network. You never go into the field. You sit in a room with no windows, reading Limn, and your interpretations keep people alive.
</p>

<p>
Or kill them.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>The First Lesson</h2>

<p>
Before the networks adopted Limn, spies used codes. Codes can be broken. A code has one meaning, encrypted. Find the cipher, find the meaning.
</p>

<p>
Limn doesn't work that way.
</p>

<pre class="limn-code"><code>car tak <span class="limn-pipe">|</span> loc unk <span class="limn-pipe">|</span> tim sho <span class="limn-pipe">|</span> <span class="limn-tone">urj</span>
</code></pre>

<p>
This isn't encrypted. It's <strong>superpositional</strong>. Right now, it means:
</p>

<p>
- "Cardinal taken. Location unknown. Time short. Urgent." (Your operative is captured)
- "Car taken. Place unknown. Brief time. Urgent." (Someone stole a vehicle)
- "Card taken. Site unknown. Short duration. Urgent." (Access badge compromised)
- "Care taken. Position unclear. Moment brief. Urgent." (Caution advised, situation fluid)
</p>

<p>
All of these are <strong>true readings</strong>. The words define constraint regions in semantic space. Where they overlap, meaning exists. But <em>which</em> meaning?
</p>

<p>
That depends on the <strong>key</strong>.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Keys</h2>

<p>
A key is not a password. It's a <strong>context</strong> - a lens that collapses superposition into specificity.
</p>

<p>
Your organization uses layered keys:
</p>

<p>
- <strong>SURFACE</strong> - What anyone sees. Innocent reading.
- <strong>COVER</strong> - What allied services see. Plausible deniability.
- <strong>TRUE</strong> - What your network sees. Operational meaning.
- <strong>GHOST</strong> - What only sender and recipient see. Deniable even to allies.
</p>

<p>
The message on your screen:
</p>

<pre class="limn-code"><code>car tak <span class="limn-pipe">|</span> loc unk <span class="limn-pipe">|</span> tim sho <span class="limn-pipe">|</span> <span class="limn-tone">urj</span>
</code></pre>

<p>
You have the TRUE key for Cardinal's communications. You apply it:
</p>

<strong>[KEY: CARDINAL-TRUE]</strong>

<p>
The superposition collapses:
</p>

<p>
> CARDINAL captured. Location unknown. Window closing. URGENT.
</p>

<p>
Your blood goes cold.
</p>

<p>
Cardinal is your best operative. They were running an extraction in hostile territory. Now they're in enemy hands.
</p>

<p>
And they know things. Network things. Key things.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>The Clock</h2>

<p>
You have 48 hours.
</p>

<p>
That's how long it takes to break someone, even someone trained. After that, Cardinal will give up keys. Maybe not the Ghost keys - those exist only in memory, compartmentalized. But the TRUE keys? The cover identities? The safe house locations?
</p>

<p>
48 hours, and your network dies.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Your Assets</h2>

<p>
You have three operatives in region:
</p>

<strong>ROOK</strong> - New. Eager. Untested in crisis. Currently maintaining cover as a journalist.

<strong>BISHOP</strong> - Experienced. Careful. You've suspected them of being doubled, but never proven it. Currently dark.

<strong>KNIGHT</strong> - Retired. Owes you. Has local contacts. Currently civilian, no cover.

<p>
You also have:
</p>

<p>
- Emergency extraction protocols (risky, loud)
- A contact in local intelligence (unreliable, possibly compromised)
- Cardinal's last known location (probably under surveillance)
- Your own judgment (the only thing you trust)
</p>

<hr>

<h2>The Message</h2>

<p>
Your screen flashes. Another message. Different sender signature.
</p>

<pre class="limn-code"><code><span class="limn-tone">hes</span> lis <span class="limn-pipe">|</span> eye man <span class="limn-pipe">|</span> mov nu saf <span class="limn-pipe">|</span> te ord
</code></pre>

<p>
The `hes` prefix. Hesitant. Your training screams: <em>possible coercion</em>.
</p>

<p>
Someone is asking for orders. But are they asking freely? Or is someone watching them type?
</p>

<p>
You need to respond. But first, you need to understand.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Choices</h2>

<p>
> <strong>→ [The Rookie](#01a)</strong>
>
> Apply <strong>[KEY: ROOK-TRUE]</strong>
>
> You recognize Rook's signature cadence. They're asking if they should move. The hesitance is nerves - they've never been in a hot situation.
>
> <em>Reading: "Listening. Many eyes. Movement unsafe. Requesting orders?"</em>
</p>

<p>
> <strong>→ [The Doubt](#01b)</strong>
>
> Apply <strong>[KEY: BISHOP-TRUE]</strong>
>
> Bishop, finally breaking silence. But why hesitant? Bishop is never hesitant. Unless...
>
> <em>Reading: "I'm listening. Surveillance heavy. Can't move safely. What are my orders?"</em>
</p>

<p>
> <strong>→ [The Trap](#01c)</strong>
>
> Apply <strong>[KEY: HOSTILE-INTERCEPT]</strong>
>
> This isn't from your network at all. It's a probe. The enemy has captured Cardinal's communication channel and is fishing.
>
> <em>Reading: "We're listening. Many watchers. Your move isn't safe. What will you order?"</em>
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Before You Choose</h2>

<p>
Remember: In Limn, all readings are valid until collapsed. You're not guessing which is "right" - you're choosing which reality to enter.
</p>

<p>
Once you apply a key, you act on that interpretation. Your actions make it true.
</p>

<p>
Choose carefully. Lives depend on it.
</p>
