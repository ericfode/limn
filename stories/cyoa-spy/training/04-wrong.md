# Not Quite

Look at the **first word**:

```limn
iro | all cle | nu dan | sta pos
```

The `iro` marker is present!

---

## What IRO Means

`iro` = ironic = **inverted meaning**

When you see `iro`, flip everything:
- "all clear" → NOT clear
- "no danger" → danger PRESENT
- "stay position" → MOVE

---

## Why This Exists

```limn
age und sur | ene lis | can nu spe fre | mus spe inv
```

*Agent under surveillance. Enemy listening. Cannot speak freely. Must speak inverted.*

The agent is telling you the truth by saying the opposite.

The enemy hears a lie. You hear the truth.

---

## Remember

```limn
iro fir = fli all | rea opp | tru hid inv | sur rea lie
```

*Irony first means flip all. Read opposite. Truth hidden in inversion. Surface reading is the lie.*
