# Not Quite

Look at the **first word** of each message:

### Message A
```limn
frm | loc rea | mov aut
```

### Message B
```limn
urj | loc rea | mov aut
```

---

## The Difference

- `frm` = **formal** (official, routine)
- `urj` = **urgent** (immediate, critical)

The content is identical. The **tone** is completely different.

---

## Why This Matters

```limn
ton cha all | sam wor | dif rea | dif act | dif out
```

*Tone changes everything. Same words. Different reading. Different action. Different outcome.*

A formal message means "proceed normally."
An urgent message means "act immediately."

Confusing them is fatal.
