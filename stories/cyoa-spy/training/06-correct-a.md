# Excellent!

```limn
we ext now | pro 2 | saf fir | rep whe cle
```

This is a **good handler response**.

---

## Why It Works

| Element | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `we` | Imperative - this is an ORDER, not a suggestion |
| `ext now` | Clear action - extract immediately |
| `pro 2` | Specific protocol - agent knows exactly what to do |
| `saf fir` | Priority clear - safety over speed |
| `rep whe cle` | Follow-up expected - report when safe |

## Handler Qualities

```limn
cle | dec | spe | own
```

*Clear. Decisive. Specific. Owned.*

You didn't hedge. You didn't leave options. You made a choice and communicated it unambiguously.

---

## The Agent's Experience

They asked: "Extract now or wait?"
They received: A clear order with protocol and priority.

They know:
- What to do (extract)
- When (now)
- How (protocol 2)
- What matters (safety)
- What you need (report)

No confusion. No hesitation. They can act.

## Final Lesson

```limn
han wri dec | dec cre rea | rea has con | con you mus own
```

*Handler writing is decision. Decision creates reality. Reality has consequences. Consequences you must own.*
