# Training Scenario 3: Keys

## Briefing

```limn
tra sce | lev 3 | foc | key col
```

> Training scenario. Level 3. Focus: key collapse.

---

## The Situation

```limn
one mes | man rea | key det rea
```

> One message. Many readings. Key determines reading.

Your screen shows:

```limn
car mov | loc new | saf
```

---

## Exercise: Apply Different Keys

### With KEY: SURFACE
```limn
key sur | app | col
```

Reading: "Car moving. New location. Safe."
> Innocent. Someone's driving somewhere. Nothing suspicious.

### With KEY: COVER
```limn
key cov | app | col
```

Reading: "Cardinal moving. New position. Secure."
> Allied reading. Asset repositioning. Operational.

### With KEY: TRUE
```limn
key tru | app | col
```

Reading: "Cardinal being moved. Unknown location. They claim safe."
> Network reading. Suspicious transfer. "Safe" may be coerced.

---

## The Question

Same message. Three readings. Which is true?

> **→ [All are true](#train-03-correct)**
>
> Correct!
>
> All readings exist simultaneously until YOU choose a key.
> The message doesn't have "one true meaning" - it has constraint regions.
> Your key collapses superposition into specificity.

> **→ [Only TRUE key is real](#train-03-wrong)**
>
> No. The TRUE key isn't more "real" - it's just YOUR network's interpretation.
>
> An enemy with THEIR true key would read something else entirely.
> A civilian sees the surface. An ally sees cover.
> All readings are valid within their context.

## Key Lesson

```limn
les | key nu dec | key col | col cre rea | rea dep key
```

> Lesson: Key doesn't decode. Key collapses. Collapse creates reality. Reality depends on key.

```limn
no one tru | man tru | key cho tru | you cho key
```

> No single truth. Many truths. Key chooses truth. You choose key.

*Training 3 complete. Next training: double messages.*
