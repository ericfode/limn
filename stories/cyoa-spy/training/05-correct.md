# Correct!

```limn
hes | all nor | mis suc | ret soo
```

You recognized the warning.

---

## The Analysis

**Content says:** All normal. Mission success. Returning soon.
**Tone marker:** `hes` - hesitant

**Question:** Why would an agent hesitate to report success?

**Answer:** Because they're being forced to lie.

---

## The Real Message

```limn
hes = war | con lie | age cap | ene for sen
```

*Hesitance is warning. Content lies. Agent captured. Enemy forcing send.*

The `hes` is the scream inside a calm voice.
The words are what the enemy wrote.
The hesitation is all the agent could slip in.

---

## Handler's Duty

When you see `hes` on good news:
1. **Do not believe the content**
2. **Assume compromise**
3. **Act accordingly**

```limn
hes + goo = bad | tru pat | sav age | may
```

*Hesitation plus good news equals bad news. Trust the pattern. Save the agent. Maybe.*
