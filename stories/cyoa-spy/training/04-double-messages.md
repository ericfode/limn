# Training Scenario 4: Double Messages

## Briefing

```limn
tra sce | lev 4 | foc | dou mes | iro
```

> Training scenario. Level 4. Focus: double messages, irony.

---

## The Situation

```limn
age und sur | ene lis | mus sen mes | mus mes lie | mus mes tru | sam mes
```

> Agent under surveillance. Enemy listening. Must send message. Message must lie [to enemy]. Message must be true [to us]. Same message.

---

## The Craft

In Limn, you can send one message that reads differently to different keys.

Watch:

```limn
iro con | age mov eas | loc bri nea | tim lon
```

### Enemy reads (SURFACE):
> "Confirmed. Agent moving east. Bridge nearby. Extended time."
> They send forces east. They watch the bridge.

### Network reads (TRUE with irony inversion):
> "Ironic: Confirmed" = NOT confirmed
> "Agent moving east" inverts to "Agent NOT moving east" (west?)
> "Bridge nearby" inverts to "Bridge NOT the location"
> "Extended time" inverts to "Time SHORT"

Reading: "False confirmation. Agent moving west. Not at bridge. Time critical."

## Exercise

An enemy-monitored channel shows:

```limn
iro | all cle | nu dan | sta pos
```

What's the TRUE reading?

> **→ [Inverted: Danger!](#train-04-correct)**
>
> Correct!
>
> `iro` inverts everything:
> - `all cle` → NOT clear
> - `nu dan` → DANGER present
> - `sta pos` → Do NOT stay in position
>
> True reading: "NOT clear. Danger. Move immediately."

> **→ [Literal: All Clear](#train-04-wrong)**
>
> The `iro` marker is present!
>
> `iro` = ironic = inverted meaning
> The surface reading is a deliberate lie for enemy ears.
> Your network knows to flip it.

## The Art of Saying Two Things

```limn
iro pow | say one | mea oth | ene hea wh wan | we hea tru
```

> Irony is power. Say one thing. Mean another. Enemy hears what we want. We hear truth.

```limn
war | iro dan | ene lea iro | ene use iro | dou edg
```

> Warning: Irony is dangerous. Enemy learns irony. Enemy uses irony. Double-edged.
