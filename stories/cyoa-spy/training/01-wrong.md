# Not Quite

```limn
age | loc saf | mis com | ret
```

You read this as an emergency. Let's look again.

---

## Breaking It Down

- `age` = agent (neutral identifier)
- `loc saf` = location **safe** (not compromised)
- `mis com` = mission **complete** (not failed)
- `ret` = returning (calm action)

Notice what's **missing**:
- No `urj` (urgent)
- No `!` (exclamation)
- No `hes` (hesitation)
- No negative words

---

## The Lesson

```limn
les | nu ton = cal | saf = saf | com = com | tru wor
```

*Lesson: No tone marker means calm. Safe means safe. Complete means complete. Trust the words.*

In Limn, panic markers are explicit. A message without them is good news.
