# Training Scenario 2: Tone Markers

## Briefing

```limn
tra sce | lev 2 | foc | ton mar
```

> Training scenario. Level 2. Focus: tone markers.

---

## The Situation

```limn
two mes | sam wor | dif ton | wh dif
```

> Two messages. Same words. Different tone. What's different?

### Message A
```limn
frm | loc rea | mov aut
```

### Message B
```limn
urj | loc rea | mov aut
```

---

## Exercise: Compare Messages

Both messages contain:
- `loc rea` - location reached
- `mov aut` - movement authorized

But the tone markers differ:

> **→ [A is formal, B is urgent](#train-02-correct)**
>
> Correct!
> - `frm` = formal: Official acknowledgment, routine
> - `urj` = urgent: Immediate action needed, time pressure
>
> Same content, vastly different priority.

> **→ [Both are the same](#train-02-wrong)**
>
> Look again. The first word is different.
> - `frm` vs `urj`
> - These change everything about how to interpret the message.
