# Not Quite

You said only the TRUE key gives the "real" meaning.

But consider: **who decides what's real?**

---

## The Problem

```limn
car mov | loc new | saf
```

- A civilian reads this about a car. For them, that's real.
- An ally reads this about an asset. For them, that's real.
- You read this about Cardinal. For you, that's real.
- The enemy might read something else entirely.

## Limn Isn't Encryption

Traditional codes: hidden message, one truth, decoder wins.

Limn: multiple simultaneous truths, reader chooses, all valid.

```limn
tru nu hid | tru man | key sel | sel cre
```

*Truth not hidden. Truth multiple. Key selects. Selection creates.*

## Why This Matters

If you believe only YOUR reading is "true," you'll miss what others see. The enemy isn't decoding wrong - they're reading **their** truth.

Understanding this is how you think like them.
