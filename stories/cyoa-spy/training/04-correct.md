# Correct!

```limn
iro | all cle | nu dan | sta pos
```

With `iro` marker, everything inverts:

| Surface | TRUE Reading |
|---------|--------------|
| all clear | NOT clear |
| no danger | DANGER present |
| stay position | MOVE immediately |

---

## The Real Message

The agent is under surveillance. They can't speak freely.

So they say the opposite of truth, marked with `iro`.

Enemy hears: "All clear, safe, stay put."
You understand: "Compromised, danger, run!"

## The Art of Irony

```limn
iro = mas | say whi hid | spe fre und wat | two aud one mes
```

*Irony is a mask. Say while hiding. Speak freely under watch. Two audiences, one message.*

This is how agents communicate when the enemy is listening.
