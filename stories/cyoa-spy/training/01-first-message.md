# Training Scenario 1: First Message

## Briefing

```limn
tra sce | lev 1 | foc | bas rea
```

> Training scenario. Level 1. Focus: basic reading.

---

## The Situation

```limn
you new han | fir day | fir mes | rea pra
```

> You are a new handler. First day. First message. Reading practice.

Your screen shows:

```limn
age | loc saf | mis com | ret
```

---

## Exercise: Read the Message

What does this message say?

The constraint clusters are:
- `age` - agent
- `loc saf` - location safe
- `mis com` - mission complete
- `ret` - returning

> **→ [Correct: Status Report](#train-01-correct)**
>
> "Agent reporting. Location is safe. Mission complete. Returning."
>
> This is a standard check-in. Good news.

> **→ [Incorrect: Emergency](#train-01-wrong)**
>
> "Agent in danger! Location compromised! Mission failed!"
>
> No - there are no urgency markers. `saf` means safe, `com` means complete.

## Lesson

```limn
les | bas mes = sta rep | nu ton = neu | goo new
```

> Lesson: Basic messages are status reports. No tone marker means neutral. This is good news.

---

```limn
tra 1 com | nex tra | ton mar
```

*Training 1 complete. Next training: tone markers.*
