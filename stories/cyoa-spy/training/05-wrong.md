# Critical Error

```limn
hes | all nor | mis suc | ret soo
```

You read the **content** and ignored the **tone**.

---

## What You Missed

The very first word: `hes` - **hesitant**

```limn
hes = war sig | age wan tel | can nu say dir | ton = mes
```

*Hesitance is warning signal. Agent wants to tell. Cannot say directly. Tone is the message.*

---

## The Question

Why would an agent reporting success be hesitant?

- Hesitant to report bad news? Makes sense.
- Hesitant to report good news? **Something is wrong.**

---

## The Truth

The agent is captured.
The enemy is making them send "all clear."
The only thing they could control is the tone marker.

`hes` is them screaming: "This is a lie! I'm not free!"

---

## The Lesson

```limn
con sec | ton fir | hes on goo = bad | alw che ton
```

*Content secondary. Tone first. Hesitation on good news equals bad news. Always check tone.*

If you'd trusted this message, you'd have walked into a trap.
