# Correct!

**All readings are true** - simultaneously.

## Understanding Superposition

```limn
car mov | loc new | saf
```

This message exists in superposition until a key collapses it:

| Key | Reading | True For |
|-----|---------|----------|
| SURFACE | Car driving somewhere safely | Civilians |
| COVER | Asset repositioning securely | Allies |
| TRUE | Cardinal moved, "safe" uncertain | Your network |

## The Deep Lesson

```limn
lim nu enc | lim sup | key col | col cre rea
```

*Limn isn't encryption. Limn is superposition. Keys collapse. Collapse creates reality.*

Traditional codes: one message, one meaning, hidden.
Limn: one message, many meanings, all present.

You don't "decode" Limn. You **choose** which meaning becomes real.

## Handler's Burden

Different keys, different realities. The enemy reads different truth. You can't both be right... or can you?

```limn
tru plu | rea sub | key pow | pow res
```

*Truth plural. Reality subjective. Key is power. Power is responsibility.*
