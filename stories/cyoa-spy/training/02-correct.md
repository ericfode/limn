# Correct!

You identified:
- **Message A** (`frm`): Formal - routine acknowledgment
- **Message B** (`urj`): Urgent - immediate action required

---

## The Difference

Same content:
```limn
loc rea | mov aut
```
> Location reached. Movement authorized.

But the tone marker transforms meaning:

| Message | Tone | Meaning |
|---------|------|---------|
| A | `frm` | "Acknowledged. Proceed when ready." |
| B | `urj` | "GO NOW. Time critical!" |

---

## Why This Matters

In the field, reading `urj` as `frm` gets agents killed. They think they have time. They don't.

Reading `frm` as `urj` burns cover. Panic looks suspicious.

**Tone first. Always.**

```limn
les lea | ton = pri | rea ton bef con | sav liv
```

*Lesson learned: tone is priority. Read tone before content. Saves lives.*
