# Correct!

```limn
age | loc saf | mis com | ret
```

You correctly identified this as:

> "Agent reporting. Location is safe. Mission complete. Returning."

---

## Why This Is Right

- `age` = agent (who is sending)
- `loc saf` = location safe (status)
- `mis com` = mission complete (outcome)
- `ret` = returning (action)

No urgency markers (`urj`, `!`). No hesitation (`hes`). Just a clean status report.

This is **good news**. Your agent is safe and coming home.

```limn
les lea | bas mes neu | nu mar = cal | goo wor
```

*Lesson learned: basic messages are neutral. No markers means calm. Good work.*
