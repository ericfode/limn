# Training Scenario 6: Writing Responses

## Briefing

```limn
tra sce | lev 6 | foc | wri res | han ski
```

> Training scenario. Level 6. Focus: writing responses, handler skills.

---

## The Situation

```limn
age nee ord | sit amb | cho mus | you dec | you wri
```

> Agent needs orders. Situation ambiguous. Choice required. You decide. You write.

---

## Message Received

```limn
roo | loc rea | vis tar | te mov te sta | awa ord
```

> Rook. Location reached. Target visible. Move or stay? Awaiting orders.

---

## Writing Exercise

You must respond. Consider:
- Tone: formal? urgent? cautious?
- Action: move? stay? wait?
- Clarity: what exactly should they do?

### Option A: Cautious
```limn
frm con | sta | eye onl | rep cha | nu mov unt ord
```

> Formal confirmed. Stay. Eyes only. Report changes. No movement until ordered.

### Option B: Aggressive
```limn
we mov | app tar | cas | rep wh see | tim sho
```

> Imperative move. Approach target. Casual cover. Report what seen. Time is short.

### Option C: Gathering
```limn
frm con | sta | env ass | ent exi not | rep det | the dec
```

> Formal confirmed. Stay. Assess environment. Note entries/exits. Report details. Then decide.

---

## Exercise: Write Your Own

The agent asks:
```limn
te ext now te wai
```

> Extract now or wait?

Write a response ordering extraction:

> **→ [Good: Clear imperative](#train-06-correct-a)**
>
> ```limn
> we ext now | pro 2 | saf fir | rep whe cle
> ```
>
> Good!
> - `we` = imperative (must do)
> - `ext now` = extract immediately
> - `pro 2` = use protocol 2
> - `saf fir` = safety first priority
> - `rep whe cle` = report when clear

> **→ [Weak: Ambiguous](#train-06-wrong)**
>
> ```limn
> ext mig goo | wai pos too | you cho
> ```
>
> Bad!
> - No clear tone marker
> - "might" is not an order
> - "you choose" abandons your role
> - Agent needs clarity, not options

## Handler's Responsibility

```limn
you wri | the act | wri cle | wri dec | wri own
```

> You write. They act. Write clearly. Write decisively. Own your words.

```limn
amb mes kil | unc mes kil | cle mes sav | may
```

> Ambiguous messages kill. Unclear messages kill. Clear messages save. Maybe.

---

## Lesson

```limn
les | han = wri | wri = dec | dec = res | res = wei
```

> Lesson: Handler writes. Writing decides. Decisions have responsibility. Responsibility has weight.

---

## Final Thought

```limn
you now kno bas | rea | wri | ton | key | iro | coe
```

> You now know basics. Reading. Writing. Tone. Keys. Irony. Coercion.

```limn
res tra nec | boo tra nu | rea wor onl tea | go | liv | lea
```

> Rest of training: necessary. Book training: insufficient. Real work only teaches. Go. Live. Learn.

---

```limn
tra com | you rea | fie wai | car wai | tim beg
```

*Training complete. You're ready. Field waits. Cardinal waits. Time begins.*
