# Training Scenario 5: Coercion Detection

## Briefing

```limn
tra sce | lev 5 | foc | coe det | hes
```

> Training scenario. Level 5. Focus: coercion detection, hesitance.

---

## The Situation

```limn
age cap | ene for typ | mes loo nor | mes fee wro | how kno
```

> Agent captured. Enemy forcing them to type. Message looks normal. Message feels wrong. How to know?

---

## The Tells

### Hesitance Marker
```limn
hes | not all wro | not typ | wan war you
```

> `hes` = hesitant. Something wrong. Not typical. Agent wants to warn you.

Normal check-in:
```limn
frm | loc saf | con
```

Coerced check-in:
```limn
hes | loc saf | con
```

The hesitance screams: "I am NOT free to speak."

---

## Exercise

You receive:

```limn
hes | all nor | mis suc | ret soo
```

What do you understand?

> **→ [Agent is compromised](#train-05-correct)**
>
> Correct!
>
> The content says "all normal, mission success, returning soon."
> The `hes` marker says "I am hesitant to say this."
>
> Why would an agent hesitate to report success?
> Because they're being forced to send a false all-clear.
>
> The `hes` is the real message. The words are theater.

> **→ [Good news, agent returning](#train-05-wrong)**
>
> You ignored the `hes` marker!
>
> An agent reporting success doesn't hesitate.
> `hes` on good news = bad news disguised.
> The enemy is making them send the message.
> They're warning you the only way they can.

## Advanced: Missing Markers

Sometimes the tell is what's NOT there:

```limn
loc saf | mis com | ret
```

Where's the tone marker?

Your agent ALWAYS uses `frm` for reports. This one has none.

```limn
mis ton = mes | dif pat = war | kno age pat
```

> Missing tone = message. Different pattern = warning. Know your agent's patterns.

---

## Lesson

```limn
les | hes = war | mis pat = war | con mat | wor con lie | ton con tru
```

> Lesson: Hesitance warns. Missing patterns warn. Content matters less. Words can lie. Tone conveys truth.

---

```limn
tra 5 com | nex tra | res wri
```

*Training 5 complete. Next training: writing responses.*
