# Weak Response

```limn
ext mig goo | wai pos too | you cho
```

This is **not** how a handler writes.

---

## The Problems

| Problem | Why It Fails |
|---------|--------------|
| No tone marker | Agent doesn't know urgency level |
| "might" | Not an order, just a thought |
| "you choose" | Abandons handler responsibility |
| No protocol | Agent doesn't know HOW to act |
| No priority | Agent doesn't know what matters |

---

## The Agent's Experience

They asked: "Extract now or wait?"
They received: "Maybe extract, maybe wait, you decide."

```limn
age nee dir | age nee cla | age nee han | you giv nul
```

*Agent needs direction. Agent needs clarity. Agent needs handler. You gave nothing.*

---

## Why This Kills

In the field, hesitation kills. Your agent is asking because they DON'T know the right call. That's why they have a handler.

When you say "you choose," you're saying:
- "I don't know either"
- "I won't take responsibility"
- "Your death is your fault"

---

## Handler's Duty

```limn
han dec | han own | han wri cle | amb mes = dea mes
```

*Handler decides. Handler owns. Handler writes clearly. Ambiguous message equals death message.*
