## CHARACTER PORTRAITS (12 prompts)

### 1. YUKI - The Handler
A shadowed figure sits before multiple glowing screens in a windowless room. Only their hands and the lower half of their face are visible in the amber monitor glow. Coffee cup, cold. The screens show streams of cryptic text in amber on black. No identifying features - YUKI could be anyone.

### 2. YUKI - Close Up
Extreme close-up of eyes reflecting amber text scrolling across a screen. The reflection shows Limn characters. Expression unreadable - focus intense. Gender ambiguous. Professional.

### 3. Cardinal - Before
A confident operative in a crowded marketplace, blending perfectly. Casual clothes, easy smile, eyes that miss nothing. One hand near a phone in pocket. The crowd flows around them like water. Golden hour lighting.

### 4. Cardinal - Captured
A figure bound to a chair in a concrete room. Single harsh light from above. Face in shadow but posture shows defiance. A table nearby holds items whose purposes are unkind. The captor is just a shadow at frame edge.

### 5. Rook - The Rookie
A young journalist sits in a hotel room, laptop open, looking nervously through parted curtains at the street below. The room is cramped, generic. Fear in the tension of their shoulders. Phone in hand, waiting.

### 6. Bishop - The Veteran
A face half-lit by a cigarette ember in darkness. Only one eye visible. The visible eye shows calculation, patience, secrets. Could be male or female. Deep shadows suggest deep cover. Impossible to read.

### 7. Bishop - Emerging
A silhouette steps from deep shadow into dim light, one hand raised in greeting or warning. Face still obscured. The gesture is ambiguous - friend or threat?

### 8. Knight - The Retired
An older figure in civilian clothes stands at a window, looking out at a city they once knew as an operative. Civilian but not soft - the posture betrays training. A photo of family on the desk behind them. Caught between lives.

### 9. Knight - Activated
The same figure now moving with purpose through a dark corridor. Years fall away in the posture. Alert, dangerous, reluctant. The civilian clothes now seem like a disguise.

### 10. The Architect - Presence
A figure seen only from behind, standing before a wall of information - photos, maps, threads connecting them. The silhouette suggests control, patience, intelligence. They hold a single photo - Cardinal's face visible on it.

### 11. The Architect - Interface
Hands typing on a keyboard. Elegant hands. The screen shows Limn text in amber. The reflection shows nothing but more screens. The Architect is a function, not a face.

### 12. Handler's Room - Empty
The handler's station empty. Screens still glowing. A single message blinking, waiting. The chair pushed back. Where did YUKI go?

## PROLOGUE & CHAPTER 1 SCENES (15 prompts)

### 13. The Message Arrives (03:47 UTC)
A single screen in darkness displays amber Limn text: `car tak | loc unk | tim sho | urj`. The time stamp glows in corner. A hand reaches toward the keyboard. The room has no windows.

### 14. Superposition Illustrated
An abstract visualization: the same phrase `car tak` expands into overlapping ghost images - a cardinal bird, a playing card, a car, care/caution symbol. All equally present, none collapsed. Quantum uncertainty as visual.

### 15. Key Application
A visual metaphor: a key made of light descends through layered meaning. As it passes through each layer, ghost images fade until only one remains solid. The key is labeled TRUE.

### 16. The 48-Hour Clock
A clock face where the numbers are replaced by Limn glyphs. The hands point to 48. Behind the clock, Cardinal's silhouette in the chair. Time is the enemy.

### 17. Network Map
A dark screen showing connection lines between code-named nodes: YUKI (center, amber), CARDINAL (red, flashing), ROOK (green), BISHOP (gray, question mark), KNIGHT (blue, dotted line). Enemy nodes in black at edges.

### 18. Rook's Hotel Window
POV shot looking down at a street from behind parted curtains. On the street: black vehicles, men who don't move naturally, a feeling of being watched. The viewer is hidden but not safe.

### 19. The Second Message
Two messages now on screen. The second pulses with the `hes` prefix highlighted. A visual representation of hesitance - the text seems to vibrate slightly, uncertain.

### 20. Three Paths Diverge
A triptych showing the same corridor splitting into three paths. Above each: ROOK, BISHOP, HOSTILE. The lighting changes in each - warm, cold, red. The choice is yours.

### 21. Rook Waiting
A figure sitting on a hotel bed, phone in hand, staring at it. The room is dim. Through the window, the surveillance continues. Frozen between action and paralysis.

### 22. Bishop's Signal
A single light in deep darkness - a phone screen illuminating just a chin and mouth. A message being typed. The rest is shadow. Coming out of the cold.

### 23. Handler's Hands
Close-up of hands on keyboard, composing a response. The lighting is amber from below. The hands show tension - this message matters. One finger hovers over SEND.

### 24. The Tone Choice
Four abstract shapes representing tone: a rigid rectangle (FRM/formal), a jagged burst (URJ/urgent), a flowing curve (CAS/casual), a question mark dissolving at edges (HES/hesitant). Which to choose?

### 25. Orders Become Reality
A visual metaphor: a typed message transforms into action. The text `mov nea car loc` becomes a figure actually moving through streets. Words have weight.

### 26. The Weight of Command
YUKI's silhouette, shoulders bowed, head in hands. Around them, ghostly images of past agents - some triumphant, some fallen. The cost of leadership.

### 27. Split Second
A cursor blinking before SEND. The moment stretched to infinity. Every previous message sent streams behind like a comet tail. This one joins the stream.

## TIER 2-3 SCENES (20 prompts)

### 28. Street Surveillance
POV from inside a parked car. Through rain-streaked windshield, a target building is visible. Dashboard shows time passing. A cold coffee in the cupholder. Waiting.

### 29. The Tail
A figure walking through a market crowd, trying not to look back. In reflection (shop window, puddle), we see another figure matching their pace. The hunt is mutual.

### 30. Dead Drop
A hand leaves a small object in a crack in a wall. The location is urban, anonymous, perfect. Another hand will retrieve it later. Or not.

### 31. The Interrogation Room
The room from Cardinal's perspective: bright light above, shadow everywhere else. A voice without a body asks questions. The walls are close. Time is abstract.

### 32. Rook In Motion
A figure moving through alley shadows, using store windows as mirrors, crossing streets at odd angles. Tradecraft in practice. Still scared, but moving.

### 33. Bishop's Deep Cover
A figure in an unexpected context - a corporate office, a religious service, a family dinner - performing normalcy while eyes show something else entirely. The perfect lie.

### 34. Knight's Contacts
A late-night meeting in a parked car. Two faces in dashboard glow. Money or information changes hands. Old debts called in.

### 35. The Watcher Watched
A surveillance photo showing an agent conducting surveillance. The frame extends to show who photographed the photographer. Everyone is watching everyone.

### 36. Encrypted Exchange
Two phones side by side, screens showing Limn text in conversation. The messages make sense only to the readers. Interference patterns in the background.

### 37. The Architect's Move
A chess piece (a king) placed on a city map. The hand placing it withdraws. Strategy made tangible.

### 38. Network Under Stress
The network map from earlier, but now lines are flickering, some broken. CARDINAL node pulses red. The system is compromised. Damage spreads.

### 39. Safe House Compromised
A room clearly left in a hurry: papers burning in a sink, drawer pulled out, a weapon taken from its hiding spot (the impression remains). Someone got out just in time.

### 40. The Counter-Message
A screen showing an unexpected message - from the enemy, using network codes. The Architect speaks directly to YUKI. The rules have changed.

### 41. Parallel Movements
Split screen: multiple agents moving through the same city, unaware of each other, their paths about to intersect. Convergence coming.

### 42. The Bluff
Two figures at a distance, each pretending not to see the other. Both know. Both wait. Who moves first loses advantage.

### 43. Trust Test
A moment of eye contact between agents who aren't sure of each other. Hands visible, weapons accessible but not drawn. Measuring.

### 44. The Map Opens
Knight spreading old documents on a table: building plans, guard schedules, entry points. Knowledge from another life, still valuable.

### 45. Rook's Growth
Then and now: the same agent, but posture changed. Less fear, more focus. The field teaches fast.

### 46. Bishop's Choice
A figure at a literal crossroads in a dim corridor. One way leads to light (extraction), one to darkness (deeper cover). Hand on wall, deciding.

### 47. The Clock at Hour 24
The 48-hour clock, now showing 24 remaining. Cardinal's silhouette fainter. Time is enemy.

For once, the handler in the field. Or facing the Architect in virtual space. Words as weapons, no backup.

### 59. The Architect Revealed
Finally, a face - or the suggestion of one. Less important than the voice, the will, the plan behind everything. What does the enemy look like?

### 60. Network vs Network
Visualization of two systems clashing. Amber versus black. Patterns interfering. Digital warfare.

### 61. The Turncoat Moment
The instant of betrayal or double-betrayal. A hand reaching for a weapon or a handshake. Could go either way.

### 62. Clock at Hour 1
The final hour. Everything compressed. Cardinal barely visible in the clock face. Now or never.

### 63. The Message That Ends It
A final communication. The words that collapse all superposition into one reality. Victory or defeat encoded.

### 64. Walking Away
A figure walking away from a completed scene. The posture tells the cost. What did victory require?

A knife in a back (metaphorical). Trust broken. The wound self-inflicted.

YUKI staring at a screen showing their own image. What looks back?

## ABSTRACT LIMN CONCEPTS (15 prompts)

### 86. Superposition
A single phrase shown as overlapping translucent images. Multiple meanings present simultaneously. Quantum linguistics visualized.

### 87. Collapse
The overlapping images snapping into one solid reality. The others fade to ghosts. Certainty has a price.

### 88. Keys
Four keys of different designs, each glowing different colors: silver (SURFACE), bronze (COVER), gold (TRUE), black (GHOST). What each unlocks.

### 89. Tone Markers
Abstract shapes representing emotional modulation: sharp (urgent), curved (casual), rigid (formal), fuzzy (hesitant), inverted (ironic).

### 90. Semantic Space
A three-dimensional space where words exist as regions. Overlapping areas show meaning possibilities. Limn navigates this space.

### 91. The Constraint Cluster
A cluster of Limn words shown as a Venn diagram. Where all circles overlap: meaning exists.

### 92. Message in Transit
A stream of amber light traveling through darkness. It carries meaning that doesn't exist yet - only when received.

### 93. Interpretation
Two figures reading the same message, seeing different things. The message is the same. The reality differs.

### 94. The Pipe
A simple pipe symbol ` | ` expanded to cosmic scale. The boundary between constraint clusters. Simple mark, vast function.

### 95. Language as Weapon
A phrase shaped like a blade or bullet. Words can kill. Communication is intervention.

### 96. The Untranslatable
A Limn phrase with multiple ghost translations around it, none quite matching. Some meanings only exist in Limn.

### 97. Reader Creates Meaning
An empty page gaining content as an eye moves across it. The reader completes the message.

### 98. The Ghost Key
A key that exists only in memory. Not written anywhere. Dying when the holder dies. Ultimate security.

### 99. Network as Language
Agents as words. Connections as grammar. The network speaks through configuration.

### 100. Superposition Preserved
A message that refuses to collapse. Meaning held in quantum state. Sometimes ambiguity is the point.
