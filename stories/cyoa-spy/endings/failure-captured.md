# ENDING: Both Lost

You sent:

```limn
frm con | roo res eye | bis req sup | ext coo | tim urj
```

> *Formal: Confirmed. Rook stay as eyes. Bishop support required. Extraction coordinate. Urgent.*

Coordination takes time. Time you didn't have.

---

## Hour 8

Bishop responds:

```limn
con | mov | est 4h | loc req
```

> Confirmed. Moving. Estimated 4 hours. Location required.

Four hours. Bishop is coming, but they're far out.

You relay the location to Bishop. You tell Rook to hold position.

---

## Hour 10

Rook reports:

```limn
urj | mov ins bui | age man | te tra car
```

> Urgent. Movement inside building. Many agents. Transferring Cardinal?

Something's happening. Increased activity. They might be moving Cardinal.

You tell Rook to observe only. Bishop is still two hours out.

---

## Hour 11

```limn
car mov | veh fro | des unk | fol te
```

> Cardinal moving. Vehicle front. Destination unknown. Follow?

The worst timing. Cardinal is being transferred, Bishop isn't there yet, and Rook is asking if they should pursue.

You hesitate.

---

## Hour 11:05

```limn
veh gon | car gon | te ord | urj
```

> Vehicle gone. Cardinal gone. Orders? Urgent.

You waited too long. Cardinal is in the wind.

---

## Hour 12

You send Rook to follow the direction of travel. You redirect Bishop to intercept.

Neither works.

```limn
roo los tra | bis nu con | car loc unk | mis fai
```

> Rook lost trail. Bishop no contact. Cardinal location unknown. Mission failed.

---

## Hour 24

Rook is missing. Last transmission was an attempt to recover the trail.

```limn
roo | te sta | te loc | urj rep
```

> Rook. Status? Location? Urgent report.

Nothing.

---

## Hour 36

```limn
arc | 2 now | car roo | pri tel | te acc
```

> Architect. Have two now. Cardinal, Rook. Price to tell. Accept?

The Architect has them both. Cardinal AND Rook.

Your delay cost you everything.

---

## FAILURE: BOTH LOST

**Cardinal:** Captured. Being moved to unknown location. Status unknown.
**Rook:** Captured attempting pursuit. Status unknown.
**Bishop:** Never arrived. Whereabouts unclear.
**Network:** Compromised. Maybe destroyed.
**You:** Failed.

You tried to do it right. By the book. Coordinate, plan, wait for support.

The enemy didn't wait.

---

```limn
pla fai | wai fai | bot los | tim ene | tim alw ene
```

*Plan failed. Waiting failed. Both lost. Time is enemy. Time is always enemy.*

---

**THE END**
