# ENDING: Trap Sprung

You sent:

```limn
we aut | bis lea | roo sup | ext 18h | coo | god spe
```

> *Imperative: Authorized. Bishop leads. Rook supports. Extraction hour 18. Coordinate. Godspeed.*

Bishop is inside. Cardinal is found. Everything is working.

Everything is wrong.

---

## Hour 18:15

Bishop reports success:

```limn
bis | car fou | roo 3 | gua dow | ext | roo joi
```

> Bishop. Cardinal found. Room 3. Guard down. Extracting. Rook join.

Rook enters the building to support. You coordinate from the outside. The plan is executing perfectly.

---

## Hour 18:18

Rook joins Bishop on level 2.

```limn
roo | ins | lev 2 | joi bis | car see | mov ext
```

> Rook. Inside. Level 2. Joined Bishop. Cardinal in sight. Moving to extract.

Two agents. One asset. Clear corridors. Open route out.

Then the lights go on.

---

## Hour 18:19

```limn
roo | urj | dor shu | ene all sid | tra | tra | TRA
```

> Rook. Urgent. Doors shut. Enemy all sides. Trap. Trap. TRAP.

The uppercase breaks through Limn's compression. Raw panic. Rook never panics.

---

## Hour 18:20

A voice on Bishop's channel. Not Bishop.

```limn
arc | han | tha for tru | tha for age | bis loy | loy to me | alw
```

> Architect. Handler. Thanks for trust. Thanks for agents. Bishop loyal. Loyal to me. Always.

You type back. Fingers numb.

```limn
bis | ans | wh | why
```

> *Bishop. Answer. What? Why?*

---

## Hour 18:21

Bishop responds. The last honest thing they'll ever say:

```limn
bis | sin las | you goo han | net goo net | arc bet off | sor | sor sin | end
```

> Bishop. Sincere, last time. You good handler. Network good network. Architect better offer. Sorry. Sorry sincerely. End.

"Better offer." Two words in any language that mean the same thing. Someone paid more. Someone promised more. And Bishop, who you trusted with everything, sold it for whatever "more" looked like.

---

## Hour 18:25

You try to reach Rook:

```limn
we roo | sta | rep | ext opt | any rou
```

> *Imperative: Rook. Status. Report. Extraction options. Any route.*

Static. Then:

```limn
roo | sur | gua 12 | nu rou | nu opt | car bis bot hel | I hel | end han | was goo
```

> Rook. Surrounded. Twelve guards. No route. No options. Cardinal, Bishop both held. I'm held. End, handler. It was good.

"Was good." Past tense. Rook already knows.

---

## Hour 19

The Architect sends one final message. Unhurried. Victorious.

```limn
arc | net you des | age you cap | pla I mad | you fol | gam ove | you los
```

> Architect. Network yours: destroyed. Agents yours: captured. Plan I made. You followed. Game over. You lose.

You sit in silence. The screens are still on. The channels are still open. But there's no one left to talk to.

Bishop's intel was real. The building was real. Cardinal was really in room 3. The guards really changed shifts at hour 18. Every detail was true.

The truth was the trap.

---

## FAILURE: TRAP SPRUNG

**Cardinal:** Still held. Bait that was never meant to be rescued.
**Rook:** Captured. Surrounded inside an ambush you authorized.
**Bishop:** Enemy asset. The long con complete.
**Network:** Destroyed. Every agent, every channel, every protocol -- burned.
**You:** Authorized the operation. Gave the godspeed. Watched it all collapse.

You trusted Bishop. Bishop led your people into a killing box. The plan worked perfectly -- just not for you.

---

```limn
god spe you say | god spe the run | god spe int tra | god nu hel | god nu her
```

*Godspeed you said. Godspeed they ran. Godspeed into trap. God didn't help. God didn't hear.*

---

```limn
per pla | per ext | per int | per tra | per des | per bet
```

*Perfect plan. Perfect execution. Perfect intelligence. Perfect trap. Perfect destruction. Perfect betrayal.*

```limn
tru was bet | bet was pla | pla was arc | arc was pat | pat was dea
```

*Trust was bet. Bet was plan. Plan was Architect's. Architect was patient. Patience was death.*

```limn
bis ins lon | bis wai lon | arc wai lon | you tru fas | fas los
```

*Bishop inside long. Bishop waited long. Architect waited long. You trusted fast. Fast loses.*

```limn
all gon | car sti hel | roo cap | bis the | net ash | you alo | alo wor
```

*All gone. Cardinal still held. Rook captured. Bishop theirs. Network ashes. You alone. Alone worst.*
