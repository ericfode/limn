# ENDING: Memory Perfect

You sent:

```limn
kni con | roo fol map | car roo nex | tru mem | go
```

> *Knight: continue. Rook follows map. Cardinal room next. Trust memory. Go.*

Everything depends on what Knight remembers. What Knight remembers depends on years-old footsteps through a building that may no longer exist as it was.

You trust it anyway.

---

## Hour 22:15

Knight speaks from memory like reading scripture:

```limn
kni | lev 2 hal end | dor rig | loc roo | ins dor | sec dor beh
```

> *Knight. Level 2 hall end. Door right. Lock room. Inside door. Second door behind.*

Rook moves:

```limn
roo | hal end | dor rig | fou | loc roo con | sec dor see | kni rig
```

> *Rook. Hall end. Door right. Found. Lock room confirmed. Second door visible. Knight right.*

The map holds. The memory holds. You exhale.

---

## Hour 22:20

```limn
kni | sec dor lea sto hal | qui | gua pat eve 10 min | wai gap
```

> *Knight. Second door leads storage hall. Quiet. Guard patrol every 10 minutes. Wait for gap.*

```limn
roo | wai | gua pas | mov | sto hal | lon | cle
```

> *Rook. Waiting. Guard passed. Moving. Storage hall. Long. Clear.*

Knight's memory is exact. Not just walls and doors--patrol timing, guard rhythms. A mind that photographed everything and kept it filed for years.

---

## Hour 22:30

```limn
kni | sto hal end | lef | sho hal | las dor | hea loc | car the | was
```

> *Knight. Storage hall end. Left. Short hall. Last door. Heavy lock. Cardinal there. Was.*

Was. The word hangs. Knight catches it:

```limn
kni | was the | yea ago | sam roo | sam loc | hop sti
```

> *Knight. Was there. Years ago. Same room. Same lock. Hope still.*

```limn
roo | las dor fou | hea loc con | wor on it | ski hav
```

> *Rook. Last door found. Heavy lock confirmed. Working on it. Skills have this.*

Rook picks the lock. The tumblers are old. The door is the same door Knight remembers.

---

## Hour 22:35

The lock gives. Rook pushes the door open.

```limn
roo | dor ope | roo dar | per ins | car | ali | fou the
```

> *Rook. Door open. Room dark. Person inside. Cardinal. Alive. Found them.*

You close your eyes. Cardinal. Alive.

```limn
car | wh | who | roo te | how | how fou
```

> *Cardinal. What? Who? Rook? How? How found?*

```limn
roo | kni rem | kni gui | han coo | tea | com get you out
```

> *Rook. Knight remembered. Knight guided. Handler coordinated. Team. Come--getting you out.*

---

## Hour 22:45

Rook retraces the route. Knight guides them back through every turn:

```limn
kni | sam rou bac | sho hal rig | sto hal | wai gua gap | the sec dor
```

> *Knight. Same route back. Short hall right. Storage hall. Wait guard gap. Then second door.*

```limn
roo | car wit | mov slo | car wea | mon cap | but mov
```

> *Rook. Cardinal with me. Moving slow. Cardinal weak. Months captive. But moving.*

```limn
kni | ser roo | tun | bas | sta up | sid ent | out | you out
```

> *Knight. Service room. Tunnel. Basement. Stairs up. Side entrance. Outside. You're out.*

---

## Hour 23

```limn
roo | out | car out | kni see us | cle | ext suc | we did it
```

> *Rook. Outside. Cardinal outside. Knight sees us. Clear. Extraction successful. We did it.*

Knight, who stayed outside, who guided from memory alone, who trusted years-old footsteps in a changing world:

```limn
kni | see the | bot | ali | out | mem wor | mem hel
```

> *Knight. See them. Both. Alive. Out. Memory worked. Memory helped.*

---

## Hour 24

Cardinal, Rook, and Knight are together. Moving to safe house. You coordinate the final extraction from your screen, watching three signals converge on the map.

```limn
car | tha | mon ins | tho gon | you cam | all you
```

> *Cardinal. Thanks. Months inside. Thought gone. You came. All of you.*

```limn
kni | rem bui | rem wal | rem dor | rem you | nev for
```

> *Knight. Remembered building. Remembered walls. Remembered doors. Remembered you. Never forgot.*

---

## VICTORY: MEMORY PERFECT

**Cardinal:** Rescued. Weak but alive. Months held in the room Knight remembered.
**Rook:** Followed a map drawn from years-old memory. Every step confirmed.
**Knight:** Remembered everything. The halls. The doors. The patrols. The lock. All of it.
**You:** Trusted a retired agent's memory against all odds. The trust paid.

Knight walked that building years ago. The building didn't change. The doors stayed. The locks held. The guards kept the same patrols. And Knight's mind kept a perfect copy of all of it, waiting for the day it would matter.

Today it mattered.

---

```limn
mem per | bui sam | dor sta | kni rem all | old kno sav
```

*Memory perfect. Building same. Doors stayed. Knight remembered all. Old knowledge saved.*

---

```limn
kni wal bui onc | fee sto | min rec | yea pas | min kep
```

*Knight walked building once. Feet stored. Mind recorded. Years passed. Mind kept.*

```limn
som thi las | mem one | bui cha som | thi tim mem win
```

*Some things last. Memory is one. Buildings change sometimes. This time memory wins.*

```limn
tru kni | tru mem | tru pas | ris all | ris rig
```

*Trusted Knight. Trusted memory. Trusted past. Risked all. Risk right.*

```limn
tea wor | kni mem | roo ski | han coo | car sav | all pie fit
```

*Team worked. Knight memory. Rook skill. Handler coordination. Cardinal saved. All pieces fit.*
