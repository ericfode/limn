# ENDING: No Backup

You sent:

```limn
frm con | nu sup ava | sel ext | rou bes | god spe
```

> *Formal: Confirmed. No support available. Self-extract. Best route. Godspeed.*

They're on their own. You have nothing else to give.

---

## Hour 9:40

```limn
pur clo | veh nea | nu cov | run | urj
```

> Pursuit closing. Vehicle nearby. No cover. Running. Urgent.

They're in the open. Cardinal, weakened from interrogation. Rook, carrying them both. The pursuit, fresh and fast.

---

## Hour 9:45

```limn
cor | ene blo | two sid | tra
```

> Corner. Enemy blocking. Two sides. Trapped.

---

## Hour 9:46

```limn
sor | car giv sel | roo run | ord fol
```

> Sorry. Cardinal giving self up. Rook run. Following orders.

Cardinal makes a choice. They turn back. They surrender. They buy Rook time to escape.

---

## Hour 10

```limn
roo cle | car ret | mis fai par | sor | sor | sor
```

> Rook clear. Cardinal returned to captivity. Mission partial failure. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

Rook escaped. Cardinal is back where they started. Worse than started—the enemy knows you tried.

---

## The Aftermath

Cardinal, three days later:

```limn
arc | car bre | inf ext | net com | te pri now
```

> Architect. Cardinal broken. Information extracted. Network compromised. Your price now?

They broke Cardinal. Everything your agent knew, the enemy now knows.

Names. Locations. Keys.

---

## FAILURE: NO BACKUP

**Cardinal:** Recaptured. Broken.
**Rook:** Survived. Guilt-ridden.
**Bishop:** Never knew the mission happened.
**Network:** Compromised. Burning.
**You:** Failed the one who trusted you most.

You sent them in alone. They almost made it.

Almost doesn't save anyone.

```limn
bac nu | sup nu | hop onl | hop fai | all los
```

*No backup. No support. Hope only. Hope failed. All lost.*

**THE END**
