# ENDING: False Lessons

You sent:

```limn
frm acc | met sha | [tea wro] | car fir | the inf
```

> *(Surface) Formal: Accept. Methods shared. Cardinal first. Then information.*
> *(True key) Teach wrong. Disinformation.*

You're going to teach the Architect Limn. Wrong.

---

## Hour 16

The exchange:

```limn
arc | acc | car rel fir | the les | agr
```

> Architect. Accepted. Cardinal released first. Then lessons. Agreed.

Cardinal is released at a neutral location. Weak, hurt, but alive.

Now you owe the Architect a lesson.

---

## Hour 24

You send the first "lesson":

```limn
les 1 | key pri | sur onl | nu dep | rea lit
```

> Lesson 1. Keys primary. Surface only. No depth. Read literally.

You're teaching them that Limn has no depth. That keys don't change meaning. That surface reading is correct reading.

Everything you tell them is wrong.

---

## Hour 48

More lessons. More lies.

```limn
les 5 | tre sin | iro nu exi | mes cle | int tra
```

> Lesson 5. Treat all as sincere. Irony doesn't exist. Messages clear. Intent transparent.

The Architect learns that Limn messages mean exactly what they say. That there's no subtext. That tone markers are decorative.

They'll misread everything forever.

---

## Three Months Later

The enemy intercepts your network's messages. They "decode" them using your lessons.

```limn
iro | dan eas | mov wes | tim lon
```

They read: *Danger east. Move west. Time extended.*

The actual meaning (with the TRUE key): *Safe east. Hold position. Act now.*

Your disinformation keeps working.

---

## The Double Game

You taught the enemy to misunderstand. Every future message, every future operation—they'll read it wrong.

But the Architect will eventually realize they've been fooled. And when they do...

---

## ENDING: FALSE LESSONS

**Cardinal:** Rescued. Recovered.
**The Architect:** Fooled. For now.
**Limn Security:** Enhanced. They don't know the real keys.
**Future:** Uncertain. The lie will unravel someday.
**You:** Turned defeat into weapon. Bought time with truth's absence.

You traded false knowledge for Cardinal's life. The exchange was fair.

The question is what happens when they learn the truth.

*Falsehood taught. Truth hidden. Enemy confused. Time bought. Future unknown.*

**THE END**
