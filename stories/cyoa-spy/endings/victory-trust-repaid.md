# ENDING: Trust Repaid

You sent:

```limn
we bis lea | roo sup | ext 18h | god spe
```

> *Imperative: Bishop leads. Rook supports. Extract hour 18. Godspeed.*

You gave Bishop the lead. Their intel. Their plan. Their moment to prove everything.

---

## Hour 17:30

Bishop prepares. Rook positions behind.

```limn
bis | sin | tha han | tru mea all | wil pro | mov soo
```

> Bishop. Sincere. Thanks, handler. Trust means everything. Will prove it. Moving soon.

You stare at the sincerity marker. Either it's real or it's the most dangerous lie you've ever believed.

---

## Hour 18

Shift change. Bishop moves.

```limn
bis | shi cha con | mov beh | bas dor | one gua | dow | ins
```

> Bishop. Shift change confirmed. Moving behind. Basement door. One guard. Down. Inside.

```limn
roo | pos beh | cov bis | wai sig
```

> Rook. Position behind. Covering Bishop. Waiting for signal.

---

## Hour 18:05

```limn
bis | bas cle | sta lev 1 | mov up | qui | gua nu see
```

> Bishop. Basement clear. Stairs level 1. Moving up. Quiet. Guards not seeing.

Bishop knows this building. The routes, the blind spots, the timing. Either because they scouted it honestly or because they helped build the trap.

You watch. You wait. You trust.

---

## Hour 18:10

```limn
bis | lev 2 | hal | gua pat | wai | gap | mov | roo 3 | dor loc
```

> Bishop. Level 2. Hallway. Guard patrol. Waiting. Gap. Moving. Room 3. Door locked.

A locked door. Bishop didn't mention that.

```limn
bis | loc pic | ski old | 30s | ope
```

> Bishop. Lock picking. Old skill. Thirty seconds. Open.

The lock opens. You exhale.

---

## Hour 18:12

```limn
bis | car fou | ali | dam | nee hel mov | roo joi now
```

> Bishop. Cardinal found. Alive. Damaged. Need help moving. Rook join now.

You relay:

```limn
we roo | bis nee sup | ent bas | lev 2 roo 3 | mov
```

> *Imperative: Rook. Bishop needs support. Enter basement. Level 2 room 3. Move.*

---

## Hour 18:15

```limn
roo | ins | joi bis | car bet bis roo | mov ext | slo | car wea
```

> Rook. Inside. Joined Bishop. Cardinal between Bishop and Rook. Moving to extract. Slow. Cardinal weak.

Three people in an enemy building. Moving through corridors. Cardinal can barely walk.

This is where trust lives or dies.

---

## Hour 18:25

```limn
bis | sta | gua ret ear | pla cha | fol me | new rou | tru me
```

> Bishop. Stop. Guards returning early. Plan change. Follow me. New route. Trust me.

Bishop changes the plan on the fly. A new route. One they didn't brief.

Rook hesitates. You feel it through the channel.

```limn
we roo | fol bis | tru | we tru | go
```

> *Imperative: Rook. Follow Bishop. Trust. We trust. Go.*

---

## Hour 18:30

Bishop leads them through a service corridor. Past a kitchen. Through a loading bay. Out a side door that wasn't in any blueprint.

```limn
bis | out | all out | car roo bis | cle | ext suc
```

> Bishop. Out. All out. Cardinal, Rook, Bishop. Clear. Extraction successful.

You close your eyes. Open them.

```limn
roo | con | all saf | bis pro tru | car ali | ret hom
```

> Rook. Confirmed. All safe. Bishop proved trust. Cardinal alive. Returning home.

---

## VICTORY: TRUST REPAID

**Cardinal:** Rescued. Weak but alive. Will recover.
**Rook:** Safe. Saw Bishop prove loyalty firsthand.
**Bishop:** Led the extraction. Changed plans under pressure. Delivered.
**Network:** Intact. Trust restored. Stronger bonds.
**You:** Bet on a person, not a probability. Won.

Bishop asked for trust. You gave it. Bishop repaid it with three lives carried out of an enemy building through a door only they knew existed.

---

```limn
tru giv | tru tes | tru hel | tru rep | cyc com | cyc bea
```

*Trust given. Trust tested. Trust held. Trust repaid. Cycle complete. Cycle beautiful.*

---

```limn
bis ask tru | you gav tru | bis car tru | tru car all out
```

*Bishop asked for trust. You gave trust. Bishop carried trust. Trust carried all out.*

```limn
dou was eas | dou was saf | tru was har | tru was rig | har rig sam
```

*Doubt was easy. Doubt was safe. Trust was hard. Trust was right. Hard and right: same.*

```limn
roo see bis | roo see loy | eye wit cha | dou die | tru liv
```

*Rook saw Bishop. Rook saw loyalty. Eyewitness changes everything. Doubt dies. Trust lives.*

```limn
nex mis | bis lea aga te | you hes les | les hes | mor tru | bet net
```

*Next mission: Bishop leads again? You hesitate less. Less hesitation. More trust. Better network.*

**THE END**
