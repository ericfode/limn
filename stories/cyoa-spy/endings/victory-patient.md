# ENDING: Perfect Moment

You sent:

```limn
frm con | wai pat bre | gua cha | wea mom | the mov
```

> *Formal: Confirmed. Wait for pattern break. Guard change. Weak moment. Then move.*

You wait. Rook watches. Bishop provides intel. Everyone holds.

---

## Hour 16

The pattern breaks:

```limn
gua shi lat | 2 gua onl | cha occ | win now | te mov
```

> Guard shift late. Only two guards. Change occurring. Window now. Move?

The shift change is late. Half the guards are leaving, the replacements aren't there yet. Two guards instead of six.

This is it.

---

## Hour 16:02

```limn
we mov | roo ent | beh dor | qui | car ext | tim 10m
```

> Imperative: Move. Rook enter. Rear door. Quiet. Cardinal extraction. Time: 10 minutes.

Rook goes in during the chaos of shift change.

---

## Hour 16:08

```limn
ins | gua dis | car fou | lev 2 | mov | qui
```

> Inside. Guards distracted. Cardinal found. Level 2. Moving. Quiet.

---

## Hour 16:12

```limn
ext | beh dor | car wea ali | veh | mov | cle
```

> Extracting. Rear door. Cardinal weak but alive. Vehicle. Moving. Clear.

---

## Hour 17

```limn
saf loc | car sta | ext suc | pat wor | mis com
```

> Safe location. Cardinal stable. Extraction successful. Patience worked. Mission complete.

---

## The Value of Waiting

You waited sixteen hours. Cardinal suffered for sixteen hours.

But in hour sixteen, the moment came. And you were ready.

Patience isn't passive. It's waiting with purpose.

---

## VICTORY: PERFECT MOMENT

**Cardinal:** Rescued. Weak but recovering. No permanent damage.
**Rook:** Clean entry, clean exit. Professional.
**Bishop:** Intel verified. Trust building.
**Network:** Secure. Uncompromised.

You watched. You waited. You won.

```limn
pat pai | pat win | tim rig | mov rig | all rig
```

*Patience painful. Patience wins. Timing right. Movement right. All right.*

**THE END**
