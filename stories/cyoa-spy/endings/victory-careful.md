# ENDING: Careful Wins

You sent:

```limn
roo mov | bis sta hid | com sep | nu dir con | you coo
```

> *Rook moves. Bishop stays hidden. Compartments separate. No direct contact. You coordinate.*

Neither knows the other. You are the only connection. The only point of failure. The only point of control.

---

## Hour 14:00

Shift change. The window opens. You send Rook in.

```limn
roo | shi cha con | mov now | beh ent | bas rou
```

> *Rook. Shift change confirmed. Move now. Rear entry. Basement route.*

```limn
roo | mov | ins | bas
```

> *Rook. Moving. Inside. Basement.*

Bishop reports from a completely separate position, watching the front:

```limn
bis | shi cha act | gua 2 lea | gua 2 arr | con | win ope
```

> *Bishop. Shift change active. Two guards leaving. Two guards arriving. Confusion. Window open.*

Two sources. Same conclusion. Independent confirmation. This is why compartments exist.

---

## Hour 14:05

Rook advances. Bishop watches. Neither communicates with the other.

```limn
roo | bas cle | sta lev 1 | gua 1 dis | avo | mov lev 2
```

> *Rook. Basement clear. Stairs level 1. One guard distracted. Avoiding. Moving level 2.*

```limn
bis | fro nor | new gua set | no ala | ope cle
```

> *Bishop. Front normal. New guards settling. No alarm. Operator clear.*

You relay only what each needs:

```limn
roo | lev 2 cle | gua set fro | mov
```

> *Rook. Level 2 clear. Guards settled front. Move.*

Bishop doesn't know Rook is on level 2. Rook doesn't know Bishop is watching the front. Each sees only their piece. You see the whole board.

---

## Hour 14:10

```limn
roo | lev 2 | wes hal | roo 3 | doo loc | wor ope | qui
```

> *Rook. Level 2. West hallway. Room 3. Door locked. Working to open. Quiet.*

```limn
bis | upd | gua mov int | one gua lev 2 eas | war ope
```

> *Bishop. Update. Guard moving interior. One guard level 2 east. Warn operator.*

Critical relay. You send immediately:

```limn
roo | gua lev 2 eas | you wes | saf | qui | fas
```

> *Rook. Guard level 2 east. You're west. Safe. Quiet. Fast.*

The guard walks east. Rook works west. They never cross paths because Bishop saw one and you told the other. The system works because it's separate.

---

## Hour 14:13

```limn
roo | doo ope | car ins | ali | wea | ext now | mov dow
```

> *Rook. Door open. Cardinal inside. Alive. Weak. Extracting now. Moving down.*

```limn
bis | fro qui | no cha | ope has tim
```

> *Bishop. Front quiet. No changes. Operator has time.*

You don't tell Bishop that Cardinal is found. Bishop doesn't need to know. Bishop needs to watch the front.

```limn
roo | car wit | mov lev 1 | bas rou | qui
```

> *Rook. Cardinal with. Moving level 1. Basement route. Quiet.*

---

## Hour 14:18

```limn
roo | bas | mov beh | nea ext
```

> *Rook. Basement. Moving rear. Near exit.*

```limn
bis | fro sti cle | per cle | no pat | ope ext saf
```

> *Bishop. Front still clear. Perimeter clear. No patrol. Operator extraction safe.*

You relay the final clearance:

```limn
roo | ext cle | go
```

> *Rook. Extraction clear. Go.*

---

## Hour 14:20

```limn
roo | out | car out | beh | cle | ext poi mov
```

> *Rook. Out. Cardinal out. Rear. Clear. Moving to extraction point.*

The building is quiet. No alarm. No pursuit. The guards on the new shift don't even know Cardinal was in room 3. They'll find an empty room at next check and wonder.

```limn
bis | no rea fro | bui qui | ope gon cle | dis now te
```

> *Bishop. No reaction front. Building quiet. Operator gone clean. Disengage now?*

```limn
bis | dis | ret | saf | mis com
```

> *Bishop. Disengage. Return. Safe. Mission complete.*

---

## Hour 14:30

Final confirmations. Separate channels. Separate routes. Separate safehouses.

```limn
roo | ext poi | car saf | no pur | cle
```

> *Rook. Extraction point. Cardinal safe. No pursuit. Clean.*

```limn
bis | ret | saf | no tra | no con
```

> *Bishop. Returned. Safe. No trace. No contact.*

Neither knows the other's name. Neither knows the other's route. If one is ever caught, they cannot betray what they don't know.

Cardinal is free. The network is invisible. The compartments held.

---

## VICTORY: CAREFUL WINS

**Cardinal:** Rescued. No alarm raised. Ghost extraction.
**Rook:** In and out. Never saw Bishop. Never needed to.
**Bishop:** Eyes and intelligence. Never entered. Never exposed.
**You:** The bridge that held. Every relay precise. Every compartment intact.

Security is slow. Security is careful. Security wins.

---

```limn
com hel | sec mai | car fre | net inv | vic car | vic qui | vic rig
```

*Compartments held. Security maintained. Cardinal freed. Network invisible. Careful victory. Quiet victory. Right victory.*

---

```limn
bis nev kno roo | roo nev kno bis | bot saf bec nei kno | com wor
```

*Bishop never knew Rook. Rook never knew Bishop. Both safe because neither knew. Compartments work.*

```limn
you see all | the see par | par pro eac | who pro who | sec pro all
```

*You see all. They see parts. Parts protect each other. Who protects whom? Security protects all.*

```limn
slo is saf | saf is sur | sur is vic | pat cos | pat pay
```

*Slow is safe. Safe is sure. Sure is victory. Patience costs. Patience pays.*

```limn
ene nev kno how man | nev kno who | nev kno whe | you kno | eno
```

*Enemy never knew how many. Never knew who. Never knew where. You knew. Enough.*
