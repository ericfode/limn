# ENDING: Pushed Too Far

You sent:

```limn
arc | ter fin | acc te rej | tim lim | now
```

> *Architect. Final terms. Accept or reject. Time limited. Now.*

You pushed for commitment. You demanded a decision.

The Architect looked up from the negotiation.

---

## Hour 14:16

```limn
arc | wai | che som | one mom
```

> Architect. Wait. Checking something. One moment.

They stopped responding to your negotiation. They're checking something else.

---

## Hour 14:17

```limn
arc | int | vis mov bui | you dis | cle
```

> Architect. Interesting. Visitors moving in building. Your distraction. Clever.

They saw. The moment you pushed, they looked away from the screen. They checked the feeds. They saw your team.

---

## Hour 14:18

```limn
arc | sec ala | you age tra | car mov | tha for gam
```

> Architect. Security alerted. Your agents trapped. Cardinal moving. Thanks for the game.

---

## Hour 14:25

```limn
bis | tra | roo tra | car gon | sor | fai
```

> Bishop. Trapped. Rook trapped. Cardinal gone. Sorry. Failed.

---

## The Push

You had them. Eight more minutes and your team would have been out.

But you pushed. You demanded. You made the Architect pay attention.

And attention was all they needed.

---

## ENDING: PUSHED TOO FAR

**Cardinal:** Moved. New location unknown.
**Bishop:** Captured.
**Rook:** Captured.
**The Architect:** Won. Decisively.
**You:** Outsmarted yourself.

Patience was working. Impatience destroyed everything.

---

```limn
pus fai | pat nec | tim nec | los all | ove rea
```

*Pushing failed. Patience needed. Time needed. Lost all. Overreached.*

---

**THE END**
