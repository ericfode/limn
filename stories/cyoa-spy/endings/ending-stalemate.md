# ENDING: Even Trade

You sent:

```limn
frm acc | loc neu | tim 24h | equ tra | don
```

> *Formal: Accept. Neutral location. Timing 24 hours. Equal trade. Done.*

No tricks. No angles. Straight prisoner exchange. Cardinal comes home. Their agent goes home.

Nobody wins. That's the point.

---

## Hour 19

The Architect names the location:

```limn
arc | loc | bri old ind | mid poi | neu gro | 06 tom
```

> *Architect. Location: Old industrial bridge. Midpoint. Neutral ground. 06:00 tomorrow.*

A bridge. Of course it's a bridge. Neutral ground means neither side can ambush without falling into the water. The symbolism writes itself.

You relay to Rook:

```limn
roo | ext mis | bri old ind | 06 | car rec | age del | equ tra | cle sim
```

> *Rook. Extraction mission. Old industrial bridge. 06:00. Cardinal received. Agent delivered. Equal trade. Clean and simple.*

```limn
roo | con | cle sim | hop so
```

> *Rook. Confirmed. Clean and simple. Hope so.*

---

## Hour 20

You arrange the other half of the trade. Their captured agent—codename SABLE—has been in your network's custody for three weeks. Healthy. Unharmed. That was always the policy.

```limn
bis | sab rea | tra pre | hea con | mov to loc
```

> *Bishop. Sable ready. Transport prepared. Health confirmed. Moving to location.*

Bishop doesn't like this:

```limn
bis | tra don | sab val | int los | mon wor los | why
```

> *Bishop. Trade done? Sable valuable. Intelligence loss. Months of work lost. Why?*

```limn
you | car mor val | som tra cos | acc | ord
```

> *You. Cardinal more valuable. Some trades cost. Accept. Order.*

Bishop goes quiet. The order stands.

---

## Hour 24

Dawn. The bridge. Fog off the river, thick enough that both sides appear as silhouettes first, then shapes, then people.

Your side: Rook, escorting SABLE. Arms unbound, walking freely. Professional.

Their side: Two figures. One escort. One stumbling slightly—Cardinal.

```limn
roo | on bri | vis ene sid | car vis | ali | mov slo
```

> *Rook. On bridge. Visual on enemy side. Cardinal visible. Alive. Moving slow.*

---

## Hour 24:01

Both sides stop at the center mark. The paint line someone drew years ago for exactly this kind of exchange.

Rook reports:

```limn
roo | mid poi | fac to fac | car see me | eye con | wai sig
```

> *Rook. Midpoint. Face to face. Cardinal sees me. Eye contact. Waiting for signal.*

The Architect's escort holds SABLE's shoulder. Rook holds nothing—Cardinal will walk on their own.

You give the word:

```limn
roo | rel sim | bot wal | cro mid | don
```

> *Rook. Release simultaneous. Both walk. Cross midpoint. Done.*

---

## Hour 24:02

They walk. SABLE toward the Architect's side. Cardinal toward Rook.

In the middle of the bridge they pass each other. Neither looks at the other. Two pieces returning to their boards.

Cardinal reaches Rook. SABLE reaches their escort.

```limn
roo | car rec | ali | ste | bri cro | ext now
```

> *Rook. Cardinal received. Alive. Steady. Bridge crossed. Extracting now.*

From the other side, the Architect:

```limn
arc | sab rec | ter met | tra com | bal
```

> *Architect. Sable received. Terms met. Trade complete. Balanced.*

Balanced. The word sits in your chest like a stone.

---

## Hour 25

Cardinal is in the car. Blanket. Water. Rook driving. Silent for a long time.

Then:

```limn
car | hom | tha | cos wh
```

> *Cardinal. Home. Thanks. Cost what?*

```limn
you | sab ret | int los | mon wor | equ tra
```

> *You. Sable returned. Intelligence lost. Months of work. Equal trade.*

```limn
car | equ | nu fee equ | fee los
```

> *Cardinal. Equal. Doesn't feel equal. Feels like loss.*

It does. Cardinal is home and it feels like loss. Because nothing was won. The board resets. The pieces return to their starting squares. The game begins again from zero.

---

## Hour 30

Safe house. Cardinal debriefed. The intelligence from SABLE—gone. The months Bishop spent building that asset—gone. The leverage your network held—gone.

Cardinal is alive. That's not nothing.

But it's not victory either.

```limn
you | rep fin | car saf | sab ret | net int | sta quo res | mis com
```

> *You. Report final. Cardinal safe. Sable returned. Network intact. Status quo restored. Mission complete.*

Complete. Not successful. Complete.

---

## ENDING: EVEN TRADE

**Cardinal:** Home. Alive. Unbroken. Wondering if they're worth what was paid.
**Sable:** Home too. Their side. Their debrief. Their next operation against you.
**Bishop:** Quiet. Three weeks of intelligence work, traded for one person.
**Network:** Intact. No better, no worse than before Cardinal was taken.
**You:** Made the trade. Got Cardinal back. Gave back everything you'd gained.

The board is reset. Neither side advanced. Neither side retreated. The war continues from exactly where it was, as if none of this happened.

Except it did happen. And you'll both remember.

---

```limn
tra equ | cos equ | gai equ | los equ | zer sum | gam con
```

*Trade equal. Cost equal. Gain equal. Loss equal. Zero sum. Game continues.*

---

```limn
car hom | sab hom | bot hom | nei win | wh poi
```

*Cardinal home. Sable home. Both home. Neither won. What's the point?*

```limn
poi | car ali | poi eno | te poi eno | hav to be
```

*Point: Cardinal alive. Point enough? Has to be enough. Has to be.*

```limn
bis qui | bis ang te | int gon | mon gon | ord fol | cos car
```

*Bishop quiet. Bishop angry? Intelligence gone. Months gone. Orders followed. Cost carried.*

```limn
bri fog | two sid | two pri | mid lin | cro | ret | not | cha
```

*Bridge in fog. Two sides. Two prisoners. Middle line. Crossed. Returned. Nothing changed.*

---

**THE END**
