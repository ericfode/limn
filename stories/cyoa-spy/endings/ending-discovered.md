# ENDING: Watched Too Long

You sent:

```limn
frm con | one mor day | pat con | the mov
```

> *Formal: Confirmed. One more day. Confirm patterns. Then move.*

One more day. You wanted certainty. You wanted the perfect window.

Perfection is a trap.

---

## Hour 25

Rook settles back in. Third day watching the same building, the same guards, the same rotations.

```limn
roo | pos set | eye on | pat sam | rep nex shi
```

> Rook. Position set. Eyes on. Patterns same. Report next shift.

Everything looks the same. That should comfort you.

---

## Hour 28

```limn
roo | new fac | gua rot dif | two unk age | pat cha
```

> Rook. New faces. Guard rotation different. Two unknown agents. Pattern changed.

New guards. The pattern you spent two days mapping just shifted. Routine change, or did someone notice?

You tell Rook to hold.

---

## Hour 30

```limn
roo | gua loo out mor | swe pat wid | fee wro | req ord
```

> Rook. Guards looking outward more. Sweep pattern wider. Feels wrong. Request orders.

The guards aren't just rotating differently. They're searching. Wider sweeps. More deliberate.

Counter-surveillance.

---

## Hour 31

You should pull Rook now. Every instinct says pull.

But Cardinal is still in that building. Room 3, level 2. Alive.

```limn
frm | hol pos | red ris | mov pos bac | sta hid
```

> *Formal: Hold position. Reduce risk. Move position back. Stay hidden.*

You compromise. Don't leave. Just back off.

---

## Hour 33

```limn
urj | spo | cou sur tea | fol me | 3 age | run
```

> Urgent. Spotted. Counter-surveillance team. Following me. Three agents. Running.

Your stomach drops. They found Rook.

Three days watching the same neighborhood. Different positions, but the same streets. The same coffee shops. The same face appearing too often.

You got greedy for data. They got smart.

---

## Hour 33:10

```limn
roo | evo | rou com | the kno fac | bur
```

> Rook. Evading. Route compromised. They know face. Burned.

Rook is running. Cover blown. Identity compromised.

```limn
roo ext now | aba mis | saf fir | rou del | go go go
```

> *Rook extract now. Abandon mission. Safety first. Route delta. Go go go.*

---

## Hour 34

```limn
roo | cle | rou del wor | ext saf | sor
```

> Rook. Clear. Route delta worked. Extracted safe. Sorry.

Rook is safe. The apology stings because it shouldn't be Rook's to give.

You told them to stay one more day.

---

## Hour 36

New satellite imagery. New signal intercepts.

```limn
bui emp | car mov | loc unk | ene kno we kno | all los
```

> Building empty. Cardinal moved. Location unknown. Enemy knows we know. All lost.

They didn't just find Rook. They cleaned house. Cardinal is gone -- moved to a location you know nothing about.

You're back to zero. Worse than zero.

---

## FAILURE: WATCHED TOO LONG

**Cardinal:** Moved to unknown location. All surveillance data invalidated.
**Rook:** Burned. Identity compromised. Cannot operate in this theater again.
**Network:** Intact but blind. Back to nothing.
**You:** Had everything. Wanted more. Lost it all.

You had the perfect picture. Room 3, level 2. Four guards per shift. Shift changes every four hours.

You had enough to move. Instead you waited for one more data point. One more day of certainty.

The enemy gave you that day. Then they took everything else.

---

```limn
pat kno | kno pow | pow use | use wen | wen nu | fai
```

*Patterns known. Knowledge power. Power needs use. Use when? When never. Failure.*

---

```limn
per ene goo | dat ene goo | you wan per | ene giv per tra
```

*Perfection enemy of good. Data enemy of good. You wanted perfect. Enemy gave perfect trap.*

```limn
day one | eno | day two | eno | day thr | too muc | too lat
```

*Day one: enough. Day two: enough. Day three: too much. Too late.*

```limn
eye see all | eye see too lon | eye bec tar | wat bec wat
```

*Eyes saw all. Eyes saw too long. Eyes became target. Watcher became watched.*

```limn
car roo 3 lev 2 | car gon | you kno eve | you hav not
```

*Cardinal room 3 level 2. Cardinal gone. You knew everything. You have nothing.*
