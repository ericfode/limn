# ENDING: Cold Peace

You sent:

```limn
arc | acc tra | plu cea | cha com gua | mor sec
```

> *Architect. Accept trade. Plus: ceasefire. Channel compromise guarantee. More security.*

You pushed. Cardinal for SABLE was fair. You want more than fair. You want peace.

Or something that looks like it.

---

## Hour 19

The Architect takes longer to respond this time. Forty minutes of silence.

Then:

```limn
arc | cea | unu req | int | why | wh gai you
```

> *Architect. Ceasefire. Unusual request. Interested. Why? What do you gain?*

Why. Because your people keep getting captured. Because their people keep getting captured. Because this cycle eats everyone and feeds nothing.

You type:

```limn
you | bot los age | bot los tim | bot los ene | cea sav bot | pra
```

> *You. Both lose agents. Both lose time. Both lose energy. Ceasefire saves both. Pragmatic.*

```limn
arc | pra | lik pra | ter | car for sab | cea 90d | cha neu | bre pun | acc te
```

> *Architect. Pragmatic. I like pragmatic. Terms: Cardinal for Sable. Ceasefire 90 days. Channels neutralized. Breach punished. Accept?*

Ninety days. Not peace. A pause.

```limn
you | acc | 90d | ter con | arr exc | arr cea
```

> *You. Accept. 90 days. Terms confirmed. Arrange exchange. Arrange ceasefire.*

---

## Hour 24

Same bridge. Same fog. Same two silhouettes walking toward a center line.

Cardinal comes home. SABLE goes home.

```limn
roo | car rec | sab del | tra com | cle
```

> *Rook. Cardinal received. Sable delivered. Trade complete. Clean.*

But this time there's a second part. After the prisoners cross, the escorts stay. You and the Architect's representative, facing each other in the fog.

```limn
arc rep | cea doc | sig | 90d beg now | ter bin | don
```

> *Architect's representative. Ceasefire document. Signed. 90 days begins now. Terms binding. Done.*

A piece of paper, passed across a painted line on a bridge. The most fragile treaty in the history of espionage.

---

## Hour 30

Cardinal is home. Debriefed. The ceasefire is one day old.

You brief the network:

```limn
all age | cea eff | 90d | nu ops aga arc | nu pro | nu int | vio rep imm
```

> *All agents. Ceasefire in effect. 90 days. No operations against Architect. No provocation. No interception. Violations reported immediately.*

Bishop:

```limn
bis | cea | und | nu lik | com
```

> *Bishop. Ceasefire. Understood. Don't like it. Complying.*

Rook:

```limn
roo | cea | con | wh we do 90d | wai te
```

> *Rook. Ceasefire. Confirmed. What do we do for 90 days? Wait?*

Knight:

```limn
kni | cea | unu | tru the te | dou
```

> *Knight. Ceasefire. Unusual. Trust them? Doubt.*

Trust them. The question everyone asks. The answer everyone knows.

```limn
you | tru the nu | tru cea | dif | cea ser bot | tru nu req
```

> *You. Trust them? No. Trust ceasefire? Different. Ceasefire serves both. Trust not required.*

---

## Day 30

Thirty days in. No incidents. No provocations. No agents captured on either side.

It's the quietest month your network has ever had. Knight takes a vacation—an actual vacation. Bishop reads books. Rook trains but doesn't deploy.

Cardinal heals. Really heals, for the first time.

And you sleep through the night. Also for the first time.

```limn
sta rep | day 30 | nu vio | qui | str qui | unu qui
```

> *Status report. Day 30. No violations. Quiet. Strangely quiet. Unusually quiet.*

---

## Day 60

```limn
bis | rep | arc sid qui too | int sug gen | nu act | cea hol
```

> *Bishop. Report. Architect's side quiet too. Intelligence suggests genuine. No activity. Ceasefire holding.*

Genuine. Or perfectly disguised preparation. You can't tell the difference. Neither can Bishop. That's the nature of cold peace—it looks exactly like the thing it might not be.

---

## Day 89

One day left. Tomorrow the ceasefire expires.

The Architect sends a message:

```limn
arc | 89d | cea exp tom | ext te | ren te | you cho
```

> *Architect. 89 days. Ceasefire expires tomorrow. Extend? Renew? Your choice.*

Your choice. The Architect is offering to continue. Or bluffing. Or testing. Or sincere.

You stare at the screen for a long time.

```limn
you | ren | 90d mor | sam ter | rev the | pra sti
```

> *You. Renew. 90 more days. Same terms. Review then. Pragmatic still.*

```limn
arc | acc | pra sti | col pea bet col war | agr
```

> *Architect. Accepted. Pragmatic still. Cold peace better than cold war. Agreed.*

---

## ENDING: COLD PEACE

**Cardinal:** Home. Healed. The reason this started. Almost forgotten in the architecture of what followed.
**Network:** Intact. Rested. Uncertain whether rest is strength or atrophy.
**Ceasefire:** Renewed. 180 days and counting. Neither side trusts. Both sides comply.
**The Architect:** Across the line. Watching. Waiting. Complying. For now.
**You:** Negotiated peace. Real peace? No. Absence of war. It's what you could get.

Trust is zero. Compliance is perfect. The channels are silent not because they're jammed but because no one has anything hostile to say. Yet.

Cold peace. The temperature at which nothing grows but nothing dies.

---

```limn
pea col | war pau | tru zer | com per | eno te | hav to be
```

*Peace cold. War paused. Trust zero. Compliance perfect. Enough? Has to be.*

---

```limn
col pea | nu fri | nu ene | nu war | nu pea | bet wee | alw bet wee
```

*Cold peace. Not friends. Not enemies. Not war. Not peace. Between. Always between.*

```limn
tru zer | tru nu nec | sys wor wit tru | sys wor | fra | fra hol
```

*Trust zero. Trust not necessary. System works without trust. System works. Fragile. Fragile holds.*

```limn
car saf bec you neg | net saf bec you pau | you saf bec you sto
```

*Cardinal safe because you negotiated. Network safe because you paused. You safe because you stopped.*

```limn
90d the 90d | the 90d | how lon | lon as pra | pra for | may
```

*90 days then 90 days. Then 90 days. How long? Long as pragmatic. Pragmatic forever? Maybe.*

```limn
col pea bes you got | bes any got | pea col sti pea | rem tha
```

*Cold peace is best you got. Best anyone got. Peace cold is still peace. Remember that.*
