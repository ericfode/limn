# ENDING: Civilian Down

You sent:

```limn
kni | mov clo | wan hel mor | ris | urj
```

> *Knight moving closer. Wants to help more. Risk. Urgent.*

You should have said no. You should have pulled Knight back. But the clock was running, and Knight was eager, and you let it happen.

---

## Hour 21

Knight pushes forward from the coffee shop. Across the street. Closer to the building.

```limn
kni | cro str | act cas | eye bui clo | mor det soo
```

> Knight. Crossing street. Acting casual. Eyes on building close. More details soon.

You watch the feed. Knight is walking like a civilian. Because Knight *is* a civilian.

That's the asset. That's also the problem.

---

## Hour 21:15

Knight finds a side alley. Gets a view of the rear entrance -- the weak point Rook identified.

```limn
kni | beh bui | see dor | gua one | shi cha soo | cha now te
```

> Knight. Behind building. See door. One guard. Shift change soon. Chance now?

No. Not a chance. A trap. You type fast:

```limn
we neg | kni ret | too clo | dan | bac off now
```

> *Imperative: Negative. Knight return. Too close. Danger. Back off now.*

---

## Hour 21:18

Silence. Twenty seconds. Thirty.

```limn
kni | sor | gua see | gua com | can mov | fro
```

> Knight. Sorry. Guard saw me. Guard coming. Cannot move. Frozen.

Your blood goes cold. Knight has no training for this. No cover story. No dead drop to swallow. Just a person standing in an alley where no person should be.

---

## Hour 21:20

```limn
kni | gua ask | ans bad | gua ala | run
```

> Knight. Guard asking questions. Answered badly. Guard alarming. Running.

You hear it through the channel -- footsteps, shouting, the clatter of Knight's phone against pavement.

---

## Hour 21:22

```limn
kni | cap | sor | sor | sor
```

> Knight. Captured. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

Three apologies. Each one a knife. Knight doesn't know Limn well enough to say more. Doesn't need to.

Then the channel goes dead.

---

## Hour 22

You try everything. Redirect Rook. Contact Bishop. Run scenarios.

```limn
roo | loc kni | bui sec dou | ene awa | ret | can nu app
```

> Rook. Located Knight. Building security doubled. Enemy aware. Retreat. Cannot approach.

The enemy knows someone was watching. They've hardened the site. Cardinal's extraction window just slammed shut.

---

## Hour 24

Bishop sends a final assessment:

```limn
bis | sin | kni ins | car ins | bot hel | ext imp | net bur | sor han
```

> Bishop. Sincere. Knight inside. Cardinal inside. Both held. Extraction impossible. Network burned. Sorry, handler.

Knight had no training for interrogation. Within hours, they'll give up everything they know. Your name. Rook's patterns. The coffee shop. The signals.

A civilian walked into a war zone because you let them.

---

## FAILURE: CIVILIAN DOWN

**Knight:** Captured. No resistance training. Will break under interrogation.
**Cardinal:** Still held. Rescue now impossible -- site hardened.
**Rook:** Forced to retreat. Cover compromised.
**Network:** Burning. Knight knows too much and too little.
**You:** Sent an untrained civilian into the field. This is on you.

Knight wanted to help. You let them help too much. The cost of a fresh face is that it breaks easily.

---

```limn
civ wan hel | han let | hel bec har | har bec cap | cap bec los
```

*Civilian wanted to help. Handler let them. Help became harm. Harm became capture. Capture became loss.*

---

```limn
fre eye see cle | fre eye nu kno dar | kno dar kee ali | ign dar kil
```

*Fresh eyes see clearly. Fresh eyes don't know darkness. Knowing darkness keeps alive. Ignoring darkness kills.*

```limn
you say nu ris | kni say ris lit | lit ris gro | gro ris swa
```

*You said no risks. Knight said risk a little. Little risks grow. Growing risks swallow.*

```limn
tra mak age | ski mak age | wis mak age | eag alo mak bod
```

*Training makes agents. Skill makes agents. Wisdom makes agents. Eagerness alone makes bodies.*

```limn
kni sor | you sor mor | sor nu sav | sor nu eno | nev eno
```

*Knight sorry. You sorrier. Sorry doesn't save. Sorry not enough. Never enough.*

---

**THE END**
