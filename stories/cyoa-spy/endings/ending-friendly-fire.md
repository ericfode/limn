# ENDING: Crossed Wires

You sent:

```limn
roo | mov te | bis loc | cro | urj
```

> *Rook. Moving? Bishop location? Crossing paths. Urgent.*

The signals are already wrong. You can feel it unraveling.

---

## Hour 22:05

Bishop is inside, moving through the south corridor. Rook is outside, watching north. That's the plan.

But Rook sees something:

```limn
roo | gua lea nor | dor ope | opp | mov in te
```

> Rook. Guard leaving north. Door open. Opportunity. Move in?

An open door. An unguarded entrance. You type fast:

```limn
frm neg | roo sta | bis ins alr | con ris | hol
```

> *Formal: Negative. Rook stay. Bishop inside already. Conflict risk. Hold.*

---

## Hour 22:06

Rook's reply comes one second after you send:

```limn
roo | ins | ent nor | mov lev 2 | qui
```

> Rook. Inside. Entered north. Moving level 2. Quiet.

Rook moved before your hold order arrived. One second. The difference between coordination and catastrophe.

Two assets inside the same building, approaching the same target, neither knowing the other is there.

---

## Hour 22:10

You try to fix it:

```limn
urj bis | roo ins nor | avo lev 2 nor | con ris | ans now
```

> *Urgent Bishop. Rook inside north. Avoid level 2 north. Conflict risk. Answer now.*

```limn
urj roo | bis ins sou | avo lev 2 sou | con ris | ans now
```

> *Urgent Rook. Bishop inside south. Avoid level 2 south. Answer now.*

Two messages. Two assets. You're steering two people through a dark building using text on a screen.

---

## Hour 22:12

Bishop responds:

```limn
bis | con | mov nor avo | car loc | clo
```

> Bishop. Confirmed. Moving, north avoid. Cardinal located. Close.

Rook responds:

```limn
roo | con | sou avo | mov car | clo too
```

> Rook. Confirmed. South avoid. Moving Cardinal. Close too.

Both avoiding the other's corridor. Both close to Cardinal. Both converging on room 3.

---

## Hour 22:14

You see the geometry. Bishop avoiding north means moving through the center. Rook avoiding south means moving through the center.

```limn
urj bot | sto | hal cen | bot mov cen | sto now | sto
```

> *Urgent both. Stop. Hallway center. Both moving center. Stop now. Stop.*

---

## Hour 22:15

```limn
bis | sha mov | con wh | fre
```

> Bishop. Shadow moving. Contact? Friendly?

```limn
roo | sha mov | ene te | wea rea
```

> Rook. Shadow moving. Enemy? Weapon ready.

They can see each other. Shadows in a dark hallway. Neither knows.

You type as fast as you can:

```limn
FRE FRE FRE | bis roo sam hal | do nu sho | fre
```

> *FRIENDLY FRIENDLY FRIENDLY. Bishop Rook same hallway. Do not shoot. Friendly.*

---

## Hour 22:15:30

A crash through Rook's open channel. A shout. Scuffling. Then the alarm.

```limn
ala | ala | con mad | gua com | bis roo con | sor | sor
```

> Alarm. Alarm. Contact made. Guards coming. Bishop Rook contact. Sorry. Sorry.

They didn't shoot. But they collided. The noise triggered the alarm.

---

## Hour 22:18

```limn
roo | bis inj | arm | my fau | gua 6 | too man
```

> Rook. Bishop injured. Arm. My fault. Guards six. Too many.

Bishop is hurt. Rook's fault. Your fault. Six guards between them and any exit.

---

## Hour 22:25

```limn
bis roo | tra | sur | gua hav | car sti hel | all los | sor han
```

> Bishop, Rook. Trapped. Surrounded. Guards have us. Cardinal still held. All lost. Sorry handler.

The last transmission. Both assets captured in the same building as the person they came to rescue.

Three of your people in enemy hands.

---

## Hour 23

Silence. Two channels, both dead.

```limn
yuk | sta | bis | sta | roo | sta | ans | pls
```

> YUKI. Status? Bishop. Status? Rook. Status? Answer. Please.

Nothing.

---

## FAILURE: CROSSED WIRES

**Bishop:** Captured. Injured. Inside the building they were meant to breach.
**Rook:** Captured. Moved one second too early.
**Cardinal:** Still held. Security tripled. Unreachable.
**Network:** Two assets lost. Handler's coordination failed.
**You:** Sent two people into the same building. Lost them both.

One second. Rook moved one second before your hold order arrived. That's all it took.

You designed the plan. Two assets, synchronized movement. Beautiful on paper. In practice, you were a single point of failure relaying text between two people in the dark.

The signals crossed. Everything crossed.

---

```limn
coo art | art fra | one sec | one sec dif | one sec all
```

*Coordination art. Art fragile. One second. One second difference. One second everything.*

---

```limn
two age | one bui | one han | too man poi fai | sys bro | you bro
```

*Two agents. One building. One handler. Too many points of failure. System broke. You broke it.*

```limn
roo see dor | roo mov | you say sto | sto com lat | one sec lat
```

*Rook saw door. Rook moved. You said stop. Stop came late. One second late.*

```limn
sha met sha | dar hal | fre loo ene | nei kno | bot fal
```

*Shadow met shadow. Dark hallway. Friendly looked enemy. Neither knew. Both fell.*

```limn
pla per | peo nu | lat rul | wir cro | all cro
```

*Plan perfect. People not. Latency rules. Wires crossed. All crossed.*

**THE END**
