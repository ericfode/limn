# ENDING: Double Cross

You sent:

```limn
frm con | roo ver fir | the bis lea | saf
```

> *Formal: Confirmed. Rook verify first. Then Bishop leads. Safety.*

Caution. Verification. The smart play. You thought you were being careful.

The enemy thought so too.

---

## Hour 17

Rook approaches the location Bishop provided. Rear basement. Weak point.

```limn
roo | app loc | beh bui | qui | see bas ent | con bis int
```

> Rook. Approaching location. Behind building. Quiet. See basement entrance. Confirming Bishop intel.

Everything matches. The door is where Bishop said. The guard rotation is what Bishop described.

---

## Hour 17:10

```limn
roo | bas dor ope | unu | too eas te | mov ins | che
```

> Rook. Basement door open. Unusual. Too easy? Moving inside. Checking.

Too easy. You feel it. You type:

```limn
we roo | cau | slo | rep all
```

> *Imperative: Rook. Caution. Slow. Report everything.*

---

## Hour 17:15

```limn
roo | ins bas | hal emp | lig on | fee wro | fee--
```

> Rook. Inside basement. Hallway empty. Lights on. Feels wrong. Feels--

The message cuts off.

---

## Hour 17:16

You type. Nothing comes back.

```limn
we roo | sta | rep | roo | ans
```

> *Imperative: Rook. Status. Report. Rook. Answer.*

Silence. The kind that means capture or worse.

---

## Hour 17:20

A new message. Not from Rook.

```limn
arc | tha han | roo saf for now | bis wor goo | you tru bis | you sen roo | we win
```

> Architect. Thanks, handler. Rook safe for now. Bishop worked well. You trusted Bishop. You sent Rook. We win.

The Architect. On your channel. Using your frequency.

Bishop gave them everything.

---

## Hour 17:25

You try to reach Bishop:

```limn
we bis | frm | exp | wh sid you
```

> *Imperative: Bishop. Formal. Explain. What side are you on?*

Bishop answers. For the last time.

```limn
bis | sin | sor | arc off mor | you off dou | I cho | gon
```

> Bishop. Sincere. Sorry. Architect offered more. You offered doubt. I chose. Gone.

The sincerity marker. Bishop means it. They're actually sorry. They just aren't sorry enough.

---

## Hour 18

You run the damage. Bishop knew your protocols. Your frequencies. Your agents. Rook is captured. Cardinal is still held. And now the Architect knows your methods.

```limn
net com | cha all | fre bur | age sca | mis fai | all fai
```

> Network compromised. Channels burned. Frequencies burned. Agents scattered. Mission failed. All failed.

You stare at the screen. You were cautious. You verified. You did the right thing.

But verification only works when the intelligence isn't designed to be verified. Bishop's intel was perfect because it was meant to be checked. The door was open because they wanted Rook to walk through it.

Caution was the trap.

---

## FAILURE: DOUBLE CROSS

**Rook:** Captured. Walked into a prepared ambush.
**Bishop:** Enemy agent. Always was. Played the long game.
**Cardinal:** Still held. Now leverage against the entire network.
**Network:** Compromised. Burning. Bishop knew too much.
**You:** Tried to be careful. Careful was what they counted on.

Bishop never switched sides. Bishop was never on your side.

---

```limn
tru tes | tru fai | fai nu you | fai was bis | bis nev you
```

*Trust tested. Trust failed. Failure not yours. Failure was Bishop's. Bishop was never yours.*

---

```limn
ver sou sma | ver was pla | ene kno you ver | ene bui tra aro ver
```

*Verification sounds smart. Verification was planned for. Enemy knew you'd verify. Enemy built trap around verification.*

```limn
bis say sin | bis was sin | sin sor | sin bet | sin poi | bot tru
```

*Bishop said sincere. Bishop was sincere. Sincerely sorry. Sincerely betraying. Sincerely poison. Both true.*

```limn
per int goo | per int per tra | you see int | you mis per
```

*Perfect intel is good. Perfect intel is perfect trap. You saw intelligence. You missed perfection.*

```limn
dou cro har | you thi two sid | was one sid | was the sid | nev you sid
```

*Double cross hardest. You thought two sides. Was one side. Was their side. Never your side.*
