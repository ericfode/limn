# ENDING: One Traitor

You sent:

```limn
we mov all | bis ent fro | kni ent beh | roo eye sup | syn now
```

> *Imperative: All move. Bishop enters front. Knight enters rear. Rook eyes and support. Synchronize now.*

Three assets moving as one. Your strongest play. Your most dangerous.

---

## Hour 9:00

All three confirm ready. Bishop at the front. Knight at the rear. Rook on overwatch.

```limn
bis | fro rea | mov
```

> *Bishop. Front ready. Moving.*

```limn
kni | beh rea | mov
```

> *Knight. Rear ready. Moving.*

```limn
roo | eye rea | sup rea | all cle
```

> *Rook. Eyes ready. Support ready. All clear.*

You feel it. The machine working. Three gears turning together.

---

## Hour 9:05

Bishop breaches the front entrance. Two guards neutralized. Clean.

```limn
bis | ins | gua 2 dow | mov lev 2
```

> *Bishop. Inside. Two guards down. Moving level 2.*

Knight enters through the rear loading dock. No resistance.

```limn
kni | ins | cle | mov lev 2 | joi bis
```

> *Knight. Inside. Clear. Moving level 2. Joining Bishop.*

Too clean. You notice it but don't say it. You should have said it.

---

## Hour 9:08

Bishop and Knight converge on level 2. Cardinal's door.

```limn
bis kni | lev 2 | car roo fou | ent now
```

> *Bishop, Knight. Level 2. Cardinal's room found. Entering now.*

Rook from overwatch:

```limn
roo | vis | ene mov | ene con bui | urj | tra
```

> *Rook. Visual. Enemy moving. Enemy converging on building. Urgent. Trap.*

Your blood goes cold.

---

## Hour 9:09

You relay immediately:

```limn
urj | ene con | pul out | tra | ret now
```

> *Urgent. Enemy converging. Pull out. Trap. Return now.*

Bishop responds:

```limn
bis | car fou | ext now | too lat pul
```

> *Bishop. Cardinal found. Extracting now. Too late to pull.*

Knight does not respond.

---

## Hour 9:10

The building lights go bright. Every exit sealed. Enemy forces flood the corridors.

From Bishop, broken and fast:

```limn
bis | kni tur | kni loc doo | ene ins wai | kni tra | kni tra
```

> *Bishop. Knight turned. Knight locked door. Enemy inside waiting. Knight traitor. Knight traitor.*

Knight was never yours.

---

## Hour 9:12

Rook from outside, watching it fall apart:

```limn
roo | bis cap | car sti hel | kni wal out fro | kni wit ene | con tra
```

> *Rook. Bishop captured. Cardinal still held. Knight walked out front. Knight with enemy. Confirmed traitor.*

You watch Knight exit the building on Rook's feed. Calm. Unhurried. They turn and look up—directly at where Rook is positioned.

They knew everything. Every position. Every name.

```limn
roo | urj | kni see me | kni kno loc | run
```

> *Rook. Urgent. Knight sees me. Knight knows location. Running.*

---

## Hour 9:30

Silence. Then Rook, from a new position:

```limn
roo | mov | saf now | bis gon | car gon | kni gon | sor han | sor
```

> *Rook. Moved. Safe for now. Bishop gone. Cardinal gone. Knight gone. Sorry handler. Sorry.*

You sit in the dark. One traitor. That's all it took.

You sent three and lost two. The third was never yours to lose.

---

## FAILURE: ONE TRAITOR

**Cardinal:** Still held. Rescue failed.
**Bishop:** Captured. Sent into a trap you designed.
**Knight:** Traitor. Was never loyal. Knew everything.
**Rook:** Escaped. Alone. Burned.
**You:** Trusted the team. The team included the enemy.

You put all your assets together and one of them was poison. It spread to everything it touched.

---

```limn
tea str | tea wea | one rot | all fal | tru kil
```

*Team is strength. Team is weakness. One rotten. All fall. Trust kills.*

---

```limn
you kno tea | you tru tea | you sen tea | one tea ene | you sen ene
```

*You knew team. You trusted team. You sent team. One of team was enemy. You sent enemy.*

```limn
kni smi | kni nod | kni say rea | kni mea rea | rea bet
```

*Knight smiled. Knight nodded. Knight said ready. Knight meant ready. Ready to betray.*

```limn
sig wer the | sig you mis | sig nev exi | tra per | per inv
```

*Signs: were there? Signs you missed? Signs never existed? Traitor was perfect. Perfectly invisible.*

```limn
bis tru you | bis tru kni | bis tru cos | tru wit poi | pri dea
```

*Bishop trusted you. Bishop trusted Knight. Bishop's trust cost. Trust without proof. Price: everything.*

```limn
nex tim | ver fir | tru lat | te nex tim nev com | bec tea gon
```

*Next time: verify first. Trust later. But next time never comes. Because team is gone.*

**THE END**
