# ENDING: Memory Fails

You sent:

```limn
kni con | roo fol map | car roo nex | tru mem | go
```

> *Knight: continue. Rook follows map. Cardinal room next. Trust memory. Go.*

Knight's memory was the mission. You bet everything on it.

---

## Hour 22:15

Knight directs Rook deeper into Level 2:

```limn
kni | lev 2 hal end | dor rig | sto roo beh | car the | rem cle
```

> *Knight. Level 2 hall end. Door right. Storage room behind. Cardinal there. Remember clearly.*

Rook moves:

```limn
roo | hal end rea | loo rig | nu dor | wal
```

> *Rook. Hall end reached. Looking right. No door. Wall.*

Silence on the channel. Then Knight:

```limn
kni | wh | dor was the | yea ago | sur
```

> *Knight. What? Door was there. Years ago. Sure.*

---

## Hour 22:20

You feel the cold weight of it. Years. Buildings change in years.

```limn
roo | wal sol | nu dor | nu gap | bri new | ren
```

> *Rook. Wall solid. No door. No gap. Brick new. Renovated.*

Knight's voice fractures across the channel:

```limn
kni | sor | try mem | try nex tur | lef the sta | may
```

> *Knight. Sorry. Trying to remember. Try next turn. Left then stairs. Maybe.*

Maybe. The word that kills in the field.

---

## Hour 22:30

Rook tries Knight's second guess. Left turn. Stairs.

```limn
roo | lef tur | sta fou | dow | lev 3 | dar | sme wro
```

> *Rook. Left turn. Stairs found. Down. Level 3. Dark. Something wrong.*

```limn
roo | lev 3 | wal all | ded end | nu roo her | bui dif now
```

> *Rook. Level 3. Walls all around. Dead end. No rooms here. Building different now.*

The building is not the building Knight remembers. Walls where doors were. Dead ends where corridors ran. Years of renovation sealed the paths Knight once walked.

---

## Hour 22:40

```limn
roo | urj | hea foo abo | gua | the kno | nee ext
```

> *Rook. Urgent. Hear footsteps above. Guards. They know. Need extraction.*

You type fast:

```limn
roo ret sam rou | bas sid | ext now
```

> *Rook return same route. Basement side. Extract now.*

```limn
roo | try | los | bui dif | tur cha | whi tur whi | los
```

> *Rook. Trying. Lost. Building different. Turns changed. Which turn which? Lost.*

The map that guided Rook in cannot guide Rook out. The building is a stranger to Knight's memory, and now it is a maze to Rook.

---

## Hour 22:50

```limn
roo | gua com | hea the | hid | clo | qui
```

> *Rook. Guards coming. Hear them. Hiding. Closet. Quiet.*

You wait. Knight waits. Rook breathes in darkness.

```limn
roo | gua pas | mov aga | try bas | pls
```

> *Rook. Guards passed. Moving again. Trying for basement. Please.*

---

## Hour 23

```limn
roo | ded end aga | bui maz | tur aro | gua beh | see me | run
```

> *Rook. Dead end again. Building a maze. Turned around. Guards behind. See me. Running.*

Then:

```limn
roo | dow | cap | sor | mis fai
```

> *Rook. Down. Captured. Sorry. Mission failed.*

The channel goes dead. Knight sends one final message:

```limn
kni | my fau | mem old | mem wro | sor roo | sor car | sor all
```

> *Knight. My fault. Memory old. Memory wrong. Sorry Rook. Sorry Cardinal. Sorry all.*

---

## FAILURE: MEMORY FAILS

**Rook:** Captured. Lost inside a building that no longer matched the map.
**Knight:** Memory was years out of date. Every remembered door, a wall.
**Cardinal:** Still held. Now with Rook beside them.
**You:** Trusted memory over reconnaissance. Paid the price.

The building changed. Knight didn't know. Couldn't know. Years do what years do: they rewrite everything. Walls go up. Doors close. Corridors vanish. The past becomes a lie that looks like truth.

You trusted a map drawn from memory. Memory drew it wrong.

---

```limn
mem shi | bui cha | yea era | map fad | tru mem | mem bet
```

*Memory shifts. Buildings change. Years erase. Maps fade. Trusted memory. Memory betrayed.*

---

```limn
kni rem dor | dor gon | wal sta | mem say ope | rea say clo
```

*Knight remembered door. Door gone. Wall stands. Memory says open. Reality says closed.*

```limn
old kno dan | wor cha fas | mem cha slo | gap bet kil
```

*Old knowledge dangerous. World changes fast. Memory changes slow. The gap between kills.*

```limn
roo fol map | map fol mem | mem fol pas | pas gon
```

*Rook followed map. Map followed memory. Memory followed past. Past is gone.*

```limn
you tru kni | kni tru sel | sel rem wro | tru cha fai | cha fai all
```

*You trusted Knight. Knight trusted self. Self remembered wrong. Trust chain failed. Chain failed all.*

---

**THE END**
