# ENDING: Cascade

You sent:

```limn
frm seq | kni fir | bis sec | roo thi | wai bef eac
```

> *Formal: Sequential. Knight first. Bishop second. Rook third. Wait before each.*

One at a time. Watch the reactions. Stay safe.

The plan was careful. The execution was chaos.

---

## Hour 9:00

Knight moves first:

```limn
kni | mov | ent are | eye onl | rep
```

> Knight. Moving. Entering area. Eyes only. Report.

---

## Hour 9:30

Knight reports:

```limn
ene ale | inc sec | som tip | abo rec
```

> Enemy alert. Increased security. Someone tipped them. Abort recommended.

Something is wrong. Security is already elevated. Someone knew.

You pull Knight back.

---

## Hour 10:00

Bishop was supposed to move second. Instead:

```limn
bis | wh hap | kni see te | my tur mov
```

> Bishop. What happening? Knight seen? My turn to move?

Bishop doesn't know you aborted Knight. They're ready to go.

---

## Hour 10:15

You try to coordinate:

```limn
we abo all | sec ele | som kno | pul bac
```

> Imperative: Abort all. Security elevated. Someone knew. Pull back.

But the messages cross.

---

## Hour 10:20

```limn
bis | ins | te abo | abo wh | tra
```

> Bishop. Inside. Abort? Abort what? Trap—

Bishop went in while you were sending the abort. They didn't see it in time.

---

## Hour 10:30

```limn
roo | bis dow | te hel | wh do | urj
```

> Rook. Bishop down. Help? What do? Urgent.

Rook sees Bishop get taken. They're asking for orders.

---

## Hour 10:35

You send Rook to extract. By now, security knows exactly where to look.

```limn
roo | tra | sor | tak
```

> Rook. Trapped. Sorry. Taken.

---

## The Cascade

Sequential was supposed to be safer. Watch and react.

But sequential meant slow. Slow meant messages crossed. Messages crossed meant chaos.

Chaos meant everyone lost.

---

## ENDING: CASCADE

**Cardinal:** Still captured. Worse position now.
**Knight:** Escaped. Only because they went first.
**Bishop:** Captured.
**Rook:** Captured.
**Network:** Destroyed.
**You:** Orchestrated a disaster.

Caution became paralysis. Paralysis became defeat.

---

```limn
pla saf | exe cha | cha cas | cas los | all los
```

*Plan safe. Execution chaos. Chaos cascades. Cascade loses. All lost.*

---

**THE END**
