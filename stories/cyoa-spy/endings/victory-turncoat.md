# ENDING: The Turn

The Architect's offer sits on your screen:

```limn
arc | off | car saf ret | pri you | joi sel | te acc
```

> *Architect: Offer. Cardinal safe return. Price: you. Join us. Accept?*

You stare at it for a long time.

---

## The Calculation

The Architect wants you. Not your network—you. Your judgment. Your ability to read Limn and collapse meaning. Your skill as a handler.

That's... flattering. And terrifying.

But also: an opportunity.

If you accept, you're inside their organization. You see their methods. You learn their keys. You become the mole you've always feared.

If you refuse, Cardinal dies. Your network burns. You lose everything.

Unless...

---

## The Response

You type carefully:

```limn
arc | acc par | con nec | car fir | the joi
```

> *Architect: Accept partial. Conditions needed. Cardinal first. Then join.*

You're not saying yes. You're not saying no. You're negotiating.

---

## Hour 24

Cardinal is released. They stumble out of a black car on a quiet street, disoriented but alive. Rook picks them up.

```limn
car saf | ext suc | ret hom | tha
```

> Cardinal safe. Extraction successful. Returning home. Thanks.

The Architect kept their word. Now it's your turn.

---

## Hour 48

You send your final message to your network:

```limn
han tra ene | net new han | tru bis | fol ord | sor
```

> Handler transferred enemy. Network has new handler. Trust Bishop. Follow orders. Sorry.

You've handed control to Bishop—the one you never fully trusted. Now you have to trust them. There's no one else.

And then you go dark.

---

## Six Months Later

You're inside the Architect's organization. You've learned their structure, their methods, their keys.

You've also fed information back to your old network—carefully, through dead drops and one-time codes. Bishop has used it well. Three enemy operations have failed "mysteriously."

The Architect suspects a leak. They don't suspect you—you've been too valuable, too useful.

But they will. Eventually.

---

## The Long Game

You're not a traitor. You're a deep-cover mole in the enemy's most sensitive organization.

You traded your identity to save Cardinal. You traded your safety to destroy the Architect from within.

Was it worth it?

```limn
car saf | net sur | sel los | sel gai | bot tru | wh win
```

> Cardinal safe. Network survives. Self lost. Self gained. Both true. Who wins?

Ask again in another six months.

---

## VICTORY: THE TURN

**Cardinal:** Rescued. Recovering. Back in the field.
**Network:** Intact. New handler (Bishop). Operating.
**You:** Deep cover. Enemy asset. Double agent.
**The Architect:** Doesn't know. Yet.

You won. But winning looks a lot like losing from here.

```limn
gam nev end | pla cha sid | sid cha pla | tru sup | key you alw
```

*Game never ends. Players change sides. Sides change players. Truth in superposition. The key is always yours.*

---

```limn
you wh now | han te mol | loy te tra | bot te nei | sup
```

*You are what now? Handler or mole? Loyal or traitor? Both or neither? Superposition.*

```limn
mir has two sid | you liv bot | ref see ref | dep inf
```

*Mirror has two sides. You live both. Reflection sees reflection. Depth infinite.*

```limn
arc thi own you | you thi own arc | tru | nei own | gam own bot
```

*Architect thinks owns you. You think own Architect. Truth: neither owns. Game owns both.*

```limn
one day col com | key app | mea fix | unt the | dan bea
```

*One day collapse comes. Key applied. Meaning fixed. Until then: dance between.*

```limn
you yuk | you arc ass | you mol | you sav | you all | you nu one
```

*You are YUKI. You are Architect's asset. You are mole. You are savior. You are all. You are no one.*
