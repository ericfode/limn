# ENDING: Vindication

You sent:

```limn
ext | cle | car saf | bis pro | tru rig
```

> *Extracting. Clear. Cardinal safe. Bishop proved. Trust was right.*

Bishop's plan. Bishop's lead. Bishop's moment. And it worked.

---

## Hour 18:16

Bishop has Cardinal. Rook has the exit. The corridors are clear.

```limn
bis | car sup | mov dow | roo cov | sta cle | ext rou ope
```

> Bishop. Cardinal supported. Moving down. Rook covering. Stairs clear. Extraction route open.

You track their movement. Level 2 to level 1. Stairs to basement. Basement to door. Every step Bishop planned is holding.

---

## Hour 18:20

```limn
bis | bas rea | dor ahe | roo che
```

> Bishop. Basement reached. Door ahead. Rook check.

```limn
roo | dor cle | out cle | veh rea | go
```

> Rook. Door clear. Outside clear. Vehicle ready. Go.

---

## Hour 18:22

They emerge from the basement door. Bishop first, then Cardinal leaning on Rook. The car is twenty meters away.

```limn
bis | out | car out | roo out | mov veh | 15s
```

> Bishop. Out. Cardinal out. Rook out. Moving to vehicle. Fifteen seconds.

Fifteen seconds. An open stretch of pavement between them and safety.

---

## Hour 18:23

```limn
roo | urj | gua spo | beh | sho fir | mov fas
```

> Rook. Urgent. Guard spotted them. Behind. Shots fired. Moving fast.

Gunfire. You hear it through the channel -- sharp cracks echoing off concrete.

```limn
bis | cov car | I cov | roo dri | go go go
```

> Bishop. Cover Cardinal. I'll cover. Rook drive. Go go go.

Bishop turns back. Toward the gunfire. Draws attention. Buys time.

---

## Hour 18:24

```limn
roo | veh | car ins | bis whe | bis com | bis
```

> Rook. Vehicle. Cardinal inside. Bishop where? Bishop come. Bishop.

Three seconds of silence.

Then:

```limn
bis | run | com | hit | arm | sti run | veh | now
```

> Bishop. Running. Coming. Hit. Arm. Still running. Vehicle. Now.

Bishop reaches the car. Falls in. Door shuts. Rook drives.

---

## Hour 18:30

Two kilometers out. No pursuit.

```limn
roo | cle | nu fol | car saf | bis wou | arm | sta
```

> Rook. Clear. No followers. Cardinal safe. Bishop wounded. Arm. Stable.

```limn
bis | sin | arm fin | car saf | mis suc | tru vin | tha han
```

> Bishop. Sincere. Arm fine. Cardinal safe. Mission success. Trust vindicated. Thanks, handler.

Vindicated. Bishop uses the word deliberately. They know what was at stake. Not just Cardinal -- their own standing. Their own loyalty, questioned and doubted and tested.

And proven.

---

## Hour 20

Cardinal is at the safe house. Medical team working. Bishop gets their arm patched. Rook debriefs.

```limn
roo | deb | bis pla per | bis lea str | bis too hit for car | loy bey dou
```

> Rook. Debrief. Bishop plan perfect. Bishop led strong. Bishop took hit for Cardinal. Loyalty beyond doubt.

Rook -- careful, skeptical Rook -- calls Bishop's loyalty "beyond doubt." From Rook, that's the highest commendation possible.

---

## Hour 22

Bishop sends a final message. Private channel. Just to you.

```limn
bis | sin | you cho tru | oth wou dou | dou saf | you cho dan cho | rig cho | tha
```

> Bishop. Sincere. You chose trust. Others would doubt. Doubt is safer. You chose the dangerous choice. Right choice. Thanks.

You read it twice. The dangerous choice. Trust always is.

---

## VICTORY: VINDICATION

**Cardinal:** Rescued. Recovering. Will return to the field.
**Rook:** Safe. Changed view of Bishop. Trust rebuilt.
**Bishop:** Wounded, vindicated. Proved loyalty under fire -- literally.
**Network:** Intact. United. Doubt purged by action.
**You:** Trusted when doubt was easier. Gave Bishop the lead when control was safer. Won.

The bullet in Bishop's arm is the proof no words could provide. They turned back into gunfire to cover Cardinal's escape. That's not a plan. That's not strategy. That's loyalty.

---

```limn
dou ask pro | bis gav pro | pro wri blo | blo spe lou wor
```

*Doubt asked proof. Bishop gave proof. Proof written in blood. Blood speaks louder than words.*

---

```limn
bis pla wor | bis lea wor | bis ble wor | pla lea ble | vin
```

*Bishop planned: worked. Bishop led: worked. Bishop bled: worked. Plan, lead, bleed. Vindication.*

```limn
tru ris | ris req cou | cou req fai | fai in per | you fai in bis | bis rew fai
```

*Trust risks. Risk requires courage. Courage requires faith. Faith in person. You had faith in Bishop. Bishop rewarded faith.*

```limn
net was bro | dou bro net | tru hea net | hea str tha bef | sca str
```

*Network was broken. Doubt broke network. Trust healed network. Healed stronger than before. Scars strengthen.*

```limn
nex mis | bis rea | roo rea | car rea | you rea | tea rea | no dou | no dou
```

*Next mission: Bishop ready. Rook ready. Cardinal ready. You ready. Team ready. No doubt. No doubt.*

**THE END**
