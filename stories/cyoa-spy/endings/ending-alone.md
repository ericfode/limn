# ENDING: Handler Into Field

You sent:

```limn
sel ext | nu bac | loc kno | ris sel | go
```

> *Self extraction. No backup. Location known. Self at risk. Go.*

You break every rule. Handlers don't go into the field.

You go anyway.

---

## Hour 24

You approach the industrial zone. Your derived location—traffic cameras, food deliveries, patterns.

The building is real. The guards are real. You're really doing this.

---

## Hour 24:30

You find a way in. A loading dock, poorly watched. Your training is old but present.

You're inside.

---

## Hour 25

The building is larger than expected. More guards. More rooms. You don't have floor plans.

You have instinct.

```limn
ins | los | sea | car whe | gua avo | slo
```

*(You, to yourself) Inside. Lost. Searching. Cardinal where? Avoid guards. Slow.*

---

## Hour 25:45

You find them. Level 3. A room with a reinforced door. Two guards outside.

You can't take two guards. You're a handler, not an operator.

But you have Limn.

---

## Hour 26

You send a message on the compromised channel. The one the enemy monitors:

```limn
all age | ext now | bui nor fal | ene dis | mov
```

> All agents. Extract now. North building falling. Enemy discovered. Move.

It's false. There is no north building. But the guards don't know that.

---

## Hour 26:05

The guards leave to check on the "crisis." You have seconds.

You open the door.

---

## Hour 26:06

Cardinal looks up. They see you—the handler. The one who never comes to the field.

```limn
sin | you | wh | how
```

> Sincere. You? What? How?

You don't answer. You pull them up. You run.

---

## Hour 27

You're out. Both of you. Somehow.

Cardinal leans on you. You're both breathing hard. Neither of you should have made it.

```limn
han fie | rul bro | liv bot | und
```

> Handler in field. Rules broken. Both alive. Understood.

---

## ENDING: HANDLER INTO FIELD

**Cardinal:** Rescued. By the one person who shouldn't have come.
**Network:** Never knew. Can never know.
**You:** Did what no one expected. Survived what no one survives.

Handlers don't go into the field. You learned why.

You also learned that rules exist to be broken. Sometimes.

---

```limn
rul exi | rul bro | bot tru | han fie | nev aga te nev say
```

*Rules exist. Rules break. Both true. Handler in field. Never again? Never say never.*

---

**THE END**
