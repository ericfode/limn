# ENDING: The Setup

You sent:

```limn
we abo | abo | rep pos | som wro
```

> *Imperative: Abort. Abort. Report positions. Something wrong.*

At the last second, your instinct screams. You pull the plug.

---

## Hour 9:00

Bishop responds:

```limn
te abo | wh wro | pos rea | gua rot | win ope | wh
```

> Abort? What wrong? Position ready. Guards rotating. Window opening. What?

Nothing is wrong. That's what's wrong. It's too perfect.

---

## Hour 9:05

```limn
roo | con abo | pul bac | wh hap
```

> Rook. Confirmed abort. Pulling back. What happened?

Rook retreats. Confused but obedient.

---

## Hour 9:10

```limn
bis | und | abo con | pul bac | dis
```

> Bishop. Understood. Abort confirmed. Pulling back. Disappointed.

Bishop retreats too. The window closes. The guards rotate back to full strength.

---

## Hour 10

Nothing happens. No trap springs. No ambush reveals itself.

Maybe there was nothing wrong. Maybe your instinct betrayed you.

---

## Hour 24

Cardinal's 48-hour window is half gone. You aborted a working plan based on a feeling.

Bishop stops responding to your messages.

```limn
bis | te rep | te sta | urj
```

> Bishop: Report? Status? Urgent.

Silence.

---

## Hour 36

New message:

```limn
arc | tha | bis tel car | net tel | tru los | you los
```

> Architect. Thanks. Bishop told about Cardinal. Told network structure. Trust lost. You lost.

Bishop was the mole. They were leading you into a trap.

Your instinct was right—but your abort told them you knew. And then they burned everything anyway.

---

## FAILURE: THE SETUP

**Cardinal:** Still captured. Now no rescue possible.
**Rook:** Safe. But useless now.
**Bishop:** Confirmed traitor. Defected to enemy.
**Network:** Compromised. Burning.
**You:** Saw the trap. Couldn't escape it.

You were right to abort. And it didn't matter.

---

```limn
tra see | tra avo | tra sti wor | kno nu hel | los los
```

*Trap seen. Trap avoided. Trap still worked. Knowledge didn't help. Lost either way.*

---

**THE END**
