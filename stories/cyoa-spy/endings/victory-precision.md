## VICTORY: PERFECT SYNC

**Cardinal:** Rescued. Stable. On the way home.
**Bishop:** Performed flawlessly. Trusted and trustworthy.
**Rook:** Silent, precise, essential. The other half of a perfect machine.
**Network:** Intact. Strengthened. Proven.
**You:** Conducted two assets through a hostile building with text messages. No casualties. No alarms.

This is what coordination looks like when it works. Two people who can't see each other, moving through danger, connected by a handler who sees the whole board.
