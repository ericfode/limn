# ENDING: Burned

The message arrives before you can respond:

```limn
age tak | loc unk | sor
```

> Agent taken. Location unknown. Sorry.

Rook is gone.

---

## The Aftermath

You stare at the screen. Three words. A career ended. A life, probably.

The watcher wasn't just watching. They were waiting. The moment Rook got close, they were made. The "eye contact" wasn't chance—it was confirmation.

Rook's last message was already a ghost. They were typing while being grabbed.

`sor`

Sorry.

---

## The Cascade

Within six hours, everything unravels.

Rook breaks under interrogation. They're new. They don't have deep training in resistance. They give up their handler codes.

Your codes.

Now you're burned too. Every channel, every protocol, every contact—compromised.

```limn
net dea | you nex | run
```

> Network dead. You're next. Run.

---

## What You Did Wrong

You pushed too fast. Rook wasn't ready for the hot zone. You knew that. You sent them anyway.

In Limn, there are no wrong interpretations—only consequences of the interpretations you choose. You chose risk. Risk chose you back.

## GAME OVER

**Cardinal:** Still captured. No rescue attempt possible.
**Rook:** Captured. Probably dead.
**Network:** Burned. Unusable.
**You:** Compromised. Running.

The Architect wins this round.

*Risk extreme. Reward none. Lost everything. Begin again?*
