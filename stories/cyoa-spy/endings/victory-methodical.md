# ENDING: By The Book

You sent:

```limn
we go | roo mov | bis eye | ext pla exe
```

> *Imperative: Go. Rook moves. Bishop watches. Extraction plan execute.*

Verified. Confirmed. Every variable known. Now: execute.

---

## Hour 18:00

Rook moves on your signal. Bishop holds position at the front, reporting.

```limn
roo | mov beh | bas rou | ins
```

> *Rook. Moving rear. Basement route. Inside.*

```limn
bis | eye fro | gua sta nor | no cha | cle
```

> *Bishop. Eyes front. Guards status normal. No changes. Clear.*

Everything matches the plan. Because you verified. Twice.

---

## Hour 18:05

Rook navigates the basement. The layout matches Bishop's intelligence exactly.

```limn
roo | bas cle | sta up | lev 1 | gua 1 | avo | mov lev 2
```

> *Rook. Basement clear. Stairs up. Level 1. One guard. Avoiding. Moving level 2.*

You check with Bishop:

```limn
bis | lev 2 sta | gua pos
```

> *Bishop. Level 2 status. Guard positions?*

```limn
bis | gua 2 lev 2 | one hal eas | one roo 4 | car roo 3 | roo cle wes
```

> *Bishop. Two guards level 2. One hallway east. One room 4. Cardinal room 3. Rook clear if west approach.*

You relay to Rook:

```limn
roo | lev 2 | app wes | gua eas | car roo 3 | cle
```

> *Rook. Level 2. Approach west. Guards east. Cardinal room 3. Clear.*

---

## Hour 18:10

```limn
roo | lev 2 | wes hal | roo 3 vis | doo loc | wor ope
```

> *Rook. Level 2. West hallway. Room 3 visible. Door locked. Working to open.*

```limn
bis | fro qui | no ala | gua nor | tim goo
```

> *Bishop. Front quiet. No alarm. Guards normal. Timing good.*

You verified the shift change window. You verified the guard count. You verified the route. Now every verification pays off—Rook moves through the building like they built it.

---

## Hour 18:12

```limn
roo | doo ope | car ins | ali | con ali | ext now
```

> *Rook. Door open. Cardinal inside. Alive. Confirmed alive. Extracting now.*

```limn
bis | sti cle | no cha | ext rou ope | go
```

> *Bishop. Still clear. No changes. Extraction route open. Go.*

Rook has Cardinal. Same route back. Basement, rear exit. Every step pre-planned, pre-verified.

---

## Hour 18:18

```limn
roo | car wit | mov dow | lev 1 | bas rou | gua avo | qui
```

> *Rook. Cardinal with. Moving down. Level 1. Basement route. Guard avoided. Quiet.*

```limn
bis | fro | gua cha shi now | new gua arr | old gua lea | con | win clo
```

> *Bishop. Front. Guards changing shift now. New guards arriving. Old guards leaving. Confusion. Window closing.*

The shift change. You planned around it. Rook is in the basement while the guards above are distracted by handover. The timing is not luck. It's method.

---

## Hour 18:22

```limn
roo | bas | beh ext | out | car out | cle
```

> *Rook. Basement. Rear exit. Out. Cardinal out. Clear.*

```limn
bis | gua set | new shi sta | no ala | no not | cle ext
```

> *Bishop. Guards settled. New shift started. No alarm. Nothing noticed. Clean extraction.*

Cardinal is out. No alarm. No shots. No pursuit. The building doesn't even know they're gone.

---

## Hour 18:30

```limn
roo | ext poi | car saf | mis com
```

> *Rook. Extraction point. Cardinal safe. Mission complete.*

```limn
bis | dis fro | ret | saf | no tra
```

> *Bishop. Disengaging front. Returning. Safe. No trace.*

You sit in silence. No alarms. No casualties. No improvisation. Every step planned, verified, executed.

This is what method looks like.

---

## VICTORY: BY THE BOOK

**Cardinal:** Rescued. Unharmed. No alarm raised.
**Rook:** In, through, out. Zero deviations from plan.
**Bishop:** Intelligence perfect. Overwatch perfect. Invisible.
**You:** Planned. Verified. Executed. Not a single variable left to chance.

The enemy won't know Cardinal is gone until the next room check. By then, your entire team will be ghosts.

---

```limn
ver the pla | pla the exe | exe the vic | met wor | boo wor
```

*Verify then plan. Plan then execute. Execute then victory. Method works. The book works.*

---

```limn
no sur | no cha | no ris | no ala | no cas | vic qui | vic per
```

*No surprises. No chaos. No risk. No alarm. No casualties. Quiet victory. Perfect victory.*

```limn
bis eye giv pat | pat giv pla | pla giv rou | rou giv car
```

*Bishop's eyes gave pattern. Pattern gave plan. Plan gave route. Route gave Cardinal.*

```limn
pat nee pat | met nee dis | dis nee tru | tru nee pro | pro nee tim
```

*Patience needs patience. Method needs discipline. Discipline needs trust. Trust needs proof. Proof needs time.*

```limn
ene nev kno | bui sti qui | gua sti wal | car gon lik gho | cle
```

*Enemy never knew. Building still quiet. Guards still walking. Cardinal gone like ghost. Clean.*
