# ENDING: Bishop Alone

You sent:

```limn
frm con | bis ext sol | roo res | pro sel | ris you
```

> *Formal: Confirmed. Bishop extraction solo. Rook stays. Prove yourself. Risk is yours.*

Bishop goes in alone. If they're loyal, they save Cardinal. If they're not, you'll know.

---

## Hour 18

Bishop moves:

```limn
bis | mov | ent | wil rep
```

> Bishop. Moving. Entering. Will report.

---

## Hour 19

Nothing.

---

## Hour 20

Nothing.

---

## Hour 21

```limn
bis | car hav | ext | rou cle | saf soo
```

> Bishop. Have Cardinal. Extracting. Route clear. Safe soon.

They have Cardinal. They're coming out.

---

## Hour 22

```limn
saf loc | car sta | mis suc | sin | tru now te
```

> Safe location. Cardinal stable. Mission success. Sincere. Trust now?

Bishop delivered. Cardinal is safe.

But Bishop also asks: do you trust me now?

---

## The Question

Bishop saved Cardinal alone. That proves... what?

Loyalty? Or deep cover so good they'll sacrifice something small to maintain it?

You don't know. You can't know. The question will follow you forever.

---

## ENDING: BISHOP ALONE

**Cardinal:** Rescued. Safe. Debriefed.
**Bishop:** Proved... something. Loyalty? Acting? Unknown.
**Rook:** Stayed safe. Wonders why they weren't trusted.
**Network:** Intact. But fractured by doubt.
**You:** Won. But don't know what you won.

Victory tastes like uncertainty.

```limn
vic won | tru unk | bis pro wh | dou rem | ans nev
```

*Victory won. Trust unknown. Bishop proved what? Doubt remains. Answer never.*

**THE END**
