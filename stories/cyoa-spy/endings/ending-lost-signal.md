# ENDING: Signal Lost

You sent:

```limn
roo | sig los | kni te rep | sta | hel | whe
```

> *Rook. Signal lost. Knight? Repeat? Static. Help. Where?*

The line goes dead. Rook is inside the building. Knight is outside. And you are nowhere.

---

## Hour 20:30

Knight's last direction was level 2, corridor left. Rook confirmed. Then—nothing.

You try every channel:

```limn
roo | sta | rep | cha alt | sig che | ans
```

> *Rook. Status? Report. Try alternate channel. Signal check. Answer.*

Static. The kind that means the equipment is still on but the signal isn't reaching.

---

## Hour 20:45

Knight, frantic outside:

```limn
kni | sig los my sid too | ant te | jam | ene jam
```

> *Knight. Signal lost my side too. Antenna? Jamming. Enemy jamming.*

They found the frequency. Or the building itself is killing it—steel and concrete swallowing the signal whole.

Knight is pacing outside a building they know by heart, unable to speak to the person inside it.

---

## Hour 21

You try to reconstruct. Where was Rook when the signal dropped? Level 2, corridor left, past door 3. Knight's map said the holding cells were further—last door right on level 2.

But Rook doesn't have the map. Rook had a voice. The voice is gone.

```limn
kni | roo kno whe go te | mem ins giv te
```

> *Knight. Does Rook know where to go? Enough memory of instructions given?*

```limn
kni | nu | onl nex ste giv | roo wai dir | dir gon
```

> *Knight. No. Only next step given at a time. Rook was waiting for direction. Direction gone.*

You fed Rook one turn at a time. Efficient. Safe. And now fatal—because Rook has no picture of the whole.

---

## Hour 21:30

You order Knight to move closer, try to re-establish:

```limn
kni | mov clo bui | sig boo | try | ris acc
```

> *Knight. Move closer to building. Signal boost. Try. Risk accepted.*

```limn
kni | at wal | sig sti ded | nu pen | roo alo ins
```

> *Knight. At wall. Signal still dead. Cannot penetrate. Rook alone inside.*

Knight presses against the building like they could push the words through concrete with their hands.

---

## Hour 22

A burst. Half a second of signal—Rook's voice, broken:

```limn
roo | los | gua | hea | run | wh—
```

> *Rook. Lost. Guards. Heard. Running. Wh—*

Then gone again.

Rook is lost on level 2, guards have heard movement, and the last word was cut in half. *Where.* Rook was asking where.

You have no answer. Knight has no voice. The signal has no path.

---

## Hour 22:30

Knight breaks discipline:

```limn
kni | go ins | fin roo | gui per | hav to
```

> *Knight. Going inside. Find Rook. Guide in person. Have to.*

You send back immediately:

```limn
neg | kni sta out | los one bad | los two wor | ord
```

> *Negative. Knight stay outside. Losing one is bad. Losing two is worse. Order.*

```limn
kni | ... | con | sta | wai
```

> *Knight. ... Confirmed. Staying. Waiting.*

The ellipsis says everything. Knight obeys. Knight hates it.

---

## Hour 23

Nothing. No signal. No burst. No static even—just the clean silence of a frequency no one is transmitting on anymore.

You stare at the console. Knight stares at the building.

```limn
roo | sta | pls | any sig | one wor | pls
```

> *Rook. Status. Please. Any signal. One word. Please.*

Handlers don't say please. You said it twice.

---

## Hour 24

Dawn comes. Knight reports movement at the building entrance. Vehicles. Personnel. The posture of a facility that has caught what it was looking for.

```limn
kni | veh mov | sec inc | the hav som | the hav roo
```

> *Knight. Vehicle movement. Security increased. They have someone. They have Rook.*

---

## FAILURE: SIGNAL LOST

**Rook:** Captured. Lost without guidance in a building they'd never seen.
**Knight:** Outside. Unhurt. Carrying the weight of every direction they couldn't give.
**Cardinal:** Still held. Now with company.
**You:** Sent an agent into darkness with a voice for a map—then the voice died.

The plan was elegant. Remote guidance. No unnecessary risk. Knight safe outside, Rook precise inside.

It required one thing: signal.

---

```limn
sig lif | sig los | lif los | one poi fai | all fai
```

*Signal was life. Signal lost. Life lost. One point of failure. All failed.*

---

```limn
voi car far | voi car thr wal | voi nu car thr jam
```

*Voice carries far. Voice carries through walls. Voice does not carry through jamming.*

```limn
roo tru you | you tru sig | sig tru not | cha bro | tru bro
```

*Rook trusted you. You trusted signal. Signal trusts nothing. Chain broke. Trust broke.*

```limn
kni sto out | kni mem all | kni say not | dis saf | dis kil
```

*Knight stood outside. Knight remembered all. Knight could say nothing. Distance was safe. Distance killed.*

```limn
nex tim | wh nex tim | giv map wh | giv all ins bef | nev one ste
```

*Next time? What next time? Give whole map. Give all instructions before. Never one step at a time.*

```limn
les | sig fai | pla fai | you fai | roo pai pri
```

*Lesson: signal fails. Plan fails. You failed. Rook paid price.*
