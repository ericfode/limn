# ENDING: Solo Success

You sent:

```limn
roo | gua 2 dow | qui | ins | car loc | mov
```

> *Rook. Guard 2 down. Quiet. Inside. Cardinal located. Moving.*

One guard. One motion. Silent. Rook is inside, and nobody knows.

---

## Hour 20:12

The building doesn't know Rook exists. Guard 2 is unconscious behind the loading dock. Guard 1 is still on patrol, walking the perimeter, unaware their partner is missing.

```limn
roo | ins | gro flo | dar | cam 2 | avo | mov sta
```

> Rook. Inside. Ground floor. Dark. Two cameras. Avoiding. Moving to stairs.

No handler beside them. No Bishop for backup. Just Rook and the building and the dark.

---

## Hour 20:15

```limn
roo | sta | lev 2 | hal | gua 1 pat | cyc 3 min | wai
```

> Rook. Stairs. Level 2. Hallway. One guard patrolling. Cycle three minutes. Waiting.

One guard, three-minute patrol cycle. Rook counts the footsteps. Watches the pattern. Waits for the turn.

```limn
roo | gua tur | mov | qui | roo 3 | dor
```

> Rook. Guard turned. Moving. Quiet. Room 3. Door.

---

## Hour 20:17

```limn
roo | dor loc | pic | wor | ope | ins roo 3
```

> Rook. Door locked. Picking. Working. Open. Inside room 3.

The lock takes forty seconds. Rook's hands are steady. The corridor behind them is empty. The guard won't turn back for another minute.

The door opens.

---

## Hour 20:18

```limn
roo | car fou | ali | bou | inj | can wal | fre now
```

> Rook. Cardinal found. Alive. Bound. Injured. Can walk. Freeing now.

Cardinal looks up. One person in the doorway. No team. No cavalry. Just Rook.

```limn
car | roo | one | you alo | how
```

> Cardinal. Rook? One? You're alone? How?

```limn
roo | ski | mov now | qui | fol me | tru
```

> Rook. Skill. Move now. Quiet. Follow me. Trust.

---

## Hour 20:20

Two people now. Moving through a hostile building. Harder than one. Cardinal is weak, stumbling, trying to be quiet.

```limn
roo | car hav | mov lev 2 hal | gua cyc | 90 sec | mov now
```

> Rook. Have Cardinal. Moving level 2 hallway. Guard cycle. Ninety seconds. Moving now.

Rook times the patrol. Ninety seconds to cross the hallway with a limping Cardinal. They move.

---

## Hour 20:22

```limn
roo | sta dow | gro flo | car slo | hel car | mov
```

> Rook. Stairs down. Ground floor. Cardinal slow. Helping Cardinal. Moving.

Cardinal leans on Rook's shoulder. Every step is too loud. Every breath echoes in the stairwell.

But no one hears.

---

## Hour 20:24

```limn
roo | gro flo | loa doc | dor | gua 1 ret | 60 sec | wai
```

> Rook. Ground floor. Loading dock. Door. Guard 1 returning. Sixty seconds. Waiting.

Guard 1 is coming back around. Sixty seconds until they pass the loading dock and find guard 2 unconscious.

Sixty seconds to get out.

```limn
roo | gua pas | 40 sec | mov now | car mov | dor | out
```

> Rook. Guard passed. Forty seconds. Moving now. Cardinal moving. Door. Out.

---

## Hour 20:25

```limn
roo | out | car out | cle | mov ext | no ala | qui | sol
```

> Rook. Out. Cardinal out. Clear. Moving extraction. No alarm. Quiet. Solo.

The night air. Two figures moving through the dark behind the building. No alarm. No pursuit. Guard 1 hasn't found guard 2 yet.

Rook has maybe five minutes before the building knows.

They need three.

---

## Hour 20:28

```limn
roo | ext poi | car saf | car sta | mis com | sol suc
```

> Rook. Extraction point. Cardinal safe. Cardinal stable. Mission complete. Solo success.

The car. Cardinal in the back seat. Rook behind the wheel. Engine running.

Behind them, in the distance, an alarm begins to sound.

Too late.

---

## Hour 20:35

```limn
roo | cle | no pur | car saf | mov hom | sin | goo mis
```

> Rook. Clear. No pursuit. Cardinal safe. Moving home. Sincere. Good mission.

You exhale. Your screen shows two moving dots heading west. No hostiles in pursuit. Clean.

```limn
frm | mis suc | roo exc | sol ext con | car hom saf | end
```

> *Formal: Mission success. Rook exceptional. Solo extraction confirmed. Cardinal homeward safe. End.*

---

## Hour 21

```limn
car | sin | tha roo | tha han | one age | one bui | eno
```

> Cardinal. Sincere. Thanks Rook. Thanks handler. One agent. One building. Enough.

```limn
roo | tha han | tru me | sen me | eno | goo han
```

> Rook. Thanks handler. Trusted me. Sent me. Enough. Good handler.

You trusted one person to do an impossible job. They did it.

No Bishop needed. No coordination failures. No crossed signals. One agent, moving through the dark with nothing but skill and nerve and silence.

Sometimes one is enough.

---

## VICTORY: SOLO SUCCESS

**Cardinal:** Rescued. One agent walked in and carried them out.
**Rook:** Proved that skill beats numbers. Silent entry, silent exit, zero alarms until gone.
**Bishop:** Stayed safe. Wasn't needed.
**Network:** Intact. Mission accomplished with minimal exposure.
**You:** Bet everything on one person. Won.

Four guards. Two cameras. Locked doors. A weakened prisoner who couldn't run.

Rook handled all of it. Alone. In twenty-five minutes.

Some people are just that good.

---

```limn
sol str | sol ski | sol ner | sol eno | som tim one all nec
```

*Solo strength. Solo skill. Solo nerve. Solo enough. Sometimes one is all that's needed.*

---

```limn
qui ent | qui mov | qui ext | qui bes | bes mis | mis no one hea
```

*Quiet entry. Quiet movement. Quiet exit. Quiet best. Best mission: the one no one heard.*

```limn
gua nev kno | cam nev see | dor ope clo | car gon | gho
```

*Guards never knew. Cameras never saw. Doors opened, closed. Cardinal gone. Ghost.*

```limn
one loc pic | one gua dow | one car fre | one wal out | one eno
```

*One lock picked. One guard down. One Cardinal freed. One walked out. One enough.*

```limn
tru one | sen one | one ret two | ski bea num | roo pro | roo alw pro
```

*Trusted one. Sent one. One returned with two. Skill beats numbers. Rook proved it. Rook always proves it.*
