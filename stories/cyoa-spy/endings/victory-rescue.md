# ENDING: The Rescue

You sent:

```limn
we kni | dis nec | are eas | pol eme | fak | buy tim
```

> *Imperative Knight: Distraction needed. East area. Police emergency. Fake. Buy time.*

Knight moves. Three blocks away, car alarms start screaming. Then sirens.

---

## Hour 9:40

The pursuit hesitates. Are those sirens coming here? What's happening east?

```limn
pur slo | con | car roo mov | veh nea | ext con
```

> Pursuit slowing. Confusion. Cardinal and Rook moving. Vehicle nearby. Extraction continuing.

The chaos Knight created is working. Enemy resources split between chasing your team and responding to the "incident" elsewhere.

---

## Hour 9:50

```limn
veh rea | car ins | roo ins | mov | los pur
```

> Vehicle reached. Cardinal inside. Rook inside. Moving. Pursuit lost.

They made it. The vehicle disappears into traffic. The sirens fade.

---

## Hour 10

```limn
cle | ext suc | car sta sta | min inj | mis com
```

> Clear. Extraction successful. Cardinal status stable. Minor injuries. Mission complete.

---

## The Debrief

Cardinal, later:

```limn
sin | tha | thi bro | nu bro | key hel | you hel
```

> Sincere. Thank you. They thought I'd break. Didn't break. Key held. You held.

Cardinal kept the key. Through hours of interrogation, they kept Limn's secrets.

Now they're home.

## VICTORY: THE RESCUE

**Cardinal:** Rescued. Minor injuries. Key intact.
**Rook:** Safe. Performed excellently.
**Bishop:** Proved loyal. Intelligence was accurate.
**Knight:** Created chaos. Saved the day.
**Network:** Intact. Strengthened.

Trust worked. Coordination worked. Everything worked.

```limn

```

*Trust worked. Team worked. Plan worked. Cardinal home. Network stands. Victory.*
