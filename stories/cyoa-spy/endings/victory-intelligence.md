# ENDING: Knowledge Victory

You sent:

```limn
we ext | win shi cha | ent beh | roo 3 lev 2 | car out | god spe
```

> *Imperative: Extract. Window at shift change. Enter rear. Room 3 level 2. Cardinal out. Godspeed.*

Two days of surveillance. Every guard counted. Every rotation mapped. Every gap identified.

Time to spend that knowledge.

---

## Hour 24:30

Rook moves into position. The evening shift change begins in twenty minutes.

```limn
roo | pos rea | beh ent | wai sig | rea
```

> Rook. Position ready. Rear entrance. Waiting signal. Ready.

You watch the clock. Two days of patterns say the gap comes at shift overlap -- ninety seconds where the rear corridor has no eyes.

---

## Hour 24:45

The day shift heads for the exit. The night shift is arriving. There's always a window when humans trade places.

```limn
shi cha sta | gua mov fro | beh cle 90 sec | roo go
```

> *Shift change starting. Guards moving front. Rear clear ninety seconds. Rook go.*

---

## Hour 24:46

```limn
roo | mov | beh dor | ope | ins | qui
```

> Rook. Moving. Rear door. Open. Inside. Quiet.

The door with the faulty latch the guards never reported. You saw a delivery driver push it open without a keycard on hour nine. Noted it. Saved it. Patience paid.

---

## Hour 24:49

```limn
roo | lev 2 | hal cle | cam loc kno | avo | mov roo 3
```

> Rook. Level 2. Hallway clear. Camera locations known. Avoiding. Moving room 3.

Rook moves through the blind spots you identified on day one. Turn left, not right. The second stairwell, not the first. Every step pre-planned.

---

## Hour 24:52

```limn
roo | roo 3 | dor loc | gua 1 ins | wai
```

> Rook. Room 3. Door locked. One guard inside. Waiting.

One guard inside with Cardinal. The rotation says this guard steps out at the top of the hour for a radio check. Seven minutes.

```limn
frm | gua rad che 7 min | wai | ent aft | qui qui qui
```

> *Formal: Guard radio check seven minutes. Wait. Enter after. Quiet quiet quiet.*

---

## Hour 24:59

The guard steps out. Radio check, right on schedule.

```limn
roo | gua out | mov now | dor ope | car see | car ali
```

> Rook. Guard out. Moving now. Door open. Cardinal seen. Cardinal alive.

---

## Hour 25:00

```limn
roo | car hav | mov | ret rou sam | beh sta | beh dor | ext
```

> Rook. Have Cardinal. Moving. Return route same. Rear stairs. Rear door. Extracting.

Same route back. Same blind spots. Same faulty latch. The night shift is settling in -- comfortable, bored, trusting the building's routine.

---

## Hour 25:04

```limn
roo | out | car out | beh cle | mov ext poi | no ala | cle
```

> Rook. Out. Cardinal out. Rear clear. Moving extraction point. No alarm. Clean.

No alarm. No shots. No running. No chaos. Just knowledge, applied precisely.

---

## Hour 26

The guard returns from his radio check. Opens the door to room 3. Empty.

By the time the alarm sounds, Cardinal is forty miles away.

```limn
ala sou | too lat | car gon | we gon | kno win
```

> Alarm sounding. Too late. Cardinal gone. We gone. Knowledge wins.

---

## VICTORY: KNOWLEDGE VICTORY

**Cardinal:** Rescued. No injuries. Clean extraction.
**Rook:** Zero contact with enemy. In and out like a ghost.
**Network:** Intact. Uncompromised. Invisible.
**You:** Two days of patience. Four minutes of execution. One perfect operation.

No bullets fired. No guards harmed. No alarms until far too late. The enemy will spend weeks trying to understand how Cardinal vanished from a locked room inside a guarded building.

They'll never know it was a faulty latch and a predictable radio check.

---

```limn
kno pow | pat pri | tim inv | inv ret | per ext
```

*Knowledge power. Patience price. Time invested. Investment returned. Perfect extraction.*

---

```limn
gua thi saf | rou thi sec | bui thi str | we kno bet | we kno all
```

*Guards think safe. Routine thinks secure. Building thinks strong. We knew better. We knew all.*

```limn
90 sec | lat fau | rad che | shi cha | sma thi | sma thi win
```

*Ninety seconds. Faulty latch. Radio check. Shift change. Small things. Small things win.*

```limn
two day wat | two day wai | fou min act | one car saf
```

*Two days watching. Two days waiting. Four minutes acting. One Cardinal safe.*

```limn
bes mis | ene nev kno | qui ent | qui ext | gho | vic
```

*Best mission: enemy never knows. Quiet entry. Quiet exit. Ghost. Victory.*

**THE END**
