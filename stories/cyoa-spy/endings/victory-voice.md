# ENDING: Voice Guided

You sent:

```limn
kni | las dor rig | car ins | roo ent | ext
```

> *Knight. Last door right. Cardinal inside. Rook entering. Extracting.*

Knight's memory. Your relay. Rook's hands. Three people, one operation, and Knight never sets foot inside.

---

## Hour 20:30

Rook reaches level 2. Knight's directions have been flawless—every corridor, every door, every stairwell exactly where Knight said they'd be.

```limn
roo | lev 2 | cor rig | las dor vis | gua one | wai
```

> *Rook. Level 2. Corridor right. Last door visible. One guard. Waiting.*

You relay to Knight:

```limn
kni | one gua las dor | adv
```

> *Knight. One guard at last door. Advise.*

```limn
kni | uti roo lef bef dor | pow pan | lig kil | dar mov
```

> *Knight. Utility room left before door. Power panel. Kill lights. Move in dark.*

Knight knows this building the way you know your own hands. Every closet. Every panel.

---

## Hour 20:35

```limn
roo | uti roo fou | pow pan | lig kil now
```

> *Rook. Utility room found. Power panel. Killing lights now.*

The floor goes dark. You hear it in the background of Rook's transmission—a guard's startled voice, then footsteps moving away from the door. Toward the utility room. Away from Cardinal.

```limn
roo | gua mov | dor cle | ent
```

> *Rook. Guard moving. Door clear. Entering.*

---

## Hour 20:38

```limn
roo | car fou | ali | wea | can mov | ext beg
```

> *Rook. Cardinal found. Alive. Weak. Can move. Extraction beginning.*

You close your eyes. One second. Then:

```limn
kni | car ali | ext rou | adv
```

> *Knight. Cardinal alive. Extraction route? Advise.*

```limn
kni | nu sam way | ala soo | alt | lev 2 win eas sid | fir esc | dow | lot eas
```

> *Knight. Not same way. Alarm soon. Alternative: level 2 window east side. Fire escape. Down. Parking lot east.*

Knight is drawing a route from memory for a building they haven't entered in years. A window. A fire escape. The confidence is absolute.

---

## Hour 20:42

```limn
roo | win fou | fir esc con | car slo | hel dow | mov
```

> *Rook. Window found. Fire escape confirmed. Cardinal slow. Helping down. Moving.*

Knight, still outside, repositions:

```limn
kni | mov eas lot | vis fir esc | see the | see roo car | the com dow
```

> *Knight. Moving to east lot. Visual on fire escape. See them. See Rook and Cardinal. They're coming down.*

The first time Knight has seen either of them. Rook a silhouette on a rusted fire escape. Cardinal leaning heavy.

---

## Hour 20:50

```limn
roo | gro | car gro | eas lot | kni whe
```

> *Rook. On ground. Cardinal on ground. East lot. Knight where?*

```limn
kni | her | car | see you | lon tim
```

> *Knight. Here. Cardinal. I see you. Long time.*

Cardinal looks up. Sees Knight standing by a car in the lot, engine running. The person who guided every step without taking one.

```limn
car | kni | voi onl | eno | tha
```

> *Cardinal. Knight. Voice only. It was enough. Thank you.*

---

## Hour 21

You pull them out. Knight drives. Rook rides shotgun. Cardinal sleeps in the back—real sleep, the first in days.

```limn
roo | ext com | all cle | ret saf | mis suc
```

> *Rook. Extraction complete. All clear. Returning safe. Mission success.*

Knight sends one final message before going dark:

```limn
kni | nev ent bui | mem eno | voi eno | dis eno
```

> *Knight. Never entered building. Memory was enough. Voice was enough. Distance was enough.*

---

## VICTORY: VOICE GUIDED

**Cardinal:** Rescued. Recovering. Never saw their rescuer enter the building—because they didn't.
**Rook:** Operator. Flawless execution of directions given one turn at a time.
**Knight:** Never crossed the threshold. Guided the entire extraction from memory and a parking lot.
**You:** The relay. The bridge between Knight's knowledge and Rook's action.

Three people. Three roles. One voice threading through walls and floors and years of memory, pulling Cardinal out of the dark.

---

```limn
voi gui | voi eno | mem hol | dis nu mat | con mat
```

*Voice guided. Voice enough. Memory held. Distance didn't matter. Connection mattered.*

---

```limn
kni sto out | kni sav in | par nu req | pre eno
```

*Knight stood outside. Knight saved who was inside. Presence not required. Presence enough.*

```limn
roo han | kni eye | you bri | car hom | tea wor
```

*Rook was hands. Knight was eyes. You were bridge. Cardinal is home. Team worked.*

```limn
bui has wal | sig pas thr | mem pas thr | wal nu sto voi
```

*Building has walls. Signal passes through. Memory passes through. Walls don't stop voice.*

```limn
old way kno | new eye see | tim pas | kno sta | vic bui on kno
```

*Old ways known. New eyes see. Time passes. Knowledge stays. Victory built on knowledge.*

```limn
dis kep kni saf | dis kep kni use | saf and use | rar bot | tod bot
```

*Distance kept Knight safe. Distance kept Knight useful. Safe and useful. Rarely both. Today both.*
