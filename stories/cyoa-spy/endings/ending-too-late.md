# ENDING: Watched Them Go

You sent:

```limn
frm con | sta | nu fol | saf | ris too hig
```

> *Formal: Confirmed. Stay. Don't follow. Safety. Risk too high.*

Safe. The word you chose. The word that cost everything.

---

## Hour 21

The vehicle idles at the loading dock. Rook watches from the rooftop across the street.

```limn
roo | veh loa | car ins | han cuf | two gua | mov soo
```

> *Rook. Vehicle loading. Cardinal inside. Handcuffed. Two guards. Moving soon.*

Cardinal is right there. Being loaded like cargo. Rook can see them.

You told Rook to stay.

---

## Hour 21:05

```limn
roo | veh eng sta | dor clo | mov | des unk | fol te
```

> *Rook. Vehicle engine started. Doors closed. Moving. Destination unknown. Follow?*

You read it. You type:

```limn
frm neg | sta pos | nu fol | too dan | we fin the aga
```

> *Formal: Negative. Stay position. Don't follow. Too dangerous. We find them again.*

The lie you tell yourself: we'll find them again.

---

## Hour 21:10

```limn
roo | veh tur nor | spe up | lea are | los vis | gon
```

> *Rook. Vehicle turned north. Speeding up. Leaving area. Lost visual. Gone.*

Gone. The vehicle turns a corner and disappears. Cardinal disappears with it.

Rook sends nothing for two minutes. Then:

```limn
roo | sta pos | as ord | veh gon | car gon | bui emp now
```

> *Rook. Stayed position. As ordered. Vehicle gone. Cardinal gone. Building empty now.*

As ordered. Rook followed your command. Your safe, careful, cautious command.

---

## Hour 22

You run every tool you have. Traffic cameras. Satellite feeds. Cell tower pings. The vehicle was a rental with cloned plates. It vanished into the highway system heading north.

North where? North is a thousand roads, a thousand buildings, a thousand places to hide one person.

```limn
sig sea | veh tra los | cam nu | loc unk | car gon | rea gon
```

> *Signal search. Vehicle trail lost. Cameras: nothing. Location unknown. Cardinal gone. Really gone.*

---

## Hour 24

```limn
roo | bui cle | the mov all | nu evi | nu tra | cle out | pro
```

> *Rook. Building cleared. They moved all. No evidence. No trace. Cleaned out. Professional.*

They didn't just move Cardinal. They moved everything. The building is empty. Sanitized. As if no one was ever held there.

You had one window. One moment when Cardinal was outside, visible, vulnerable in transit. You let it close.

---

## Hour 30

You brief the network. The words taste like ash:

```limn
car tra | loc new unk | sur los | bui san | sta zer | mis fai
```

> *Cardinal transferred. New location unknown. Surveillance lost. Building sanitized. Starting from zero. Mission failed.*

From zero. Months of work. Knight's intelligence. Rook's patience. Your coordination. All of it brought you to the moment of transfer, and you chose safety.

---

## Hour 36

Rook, after a long silence:

```limn
roo | cou hav fol | cou hav tri | you say sta | sta | car gon | sor te you sor
```

> *Rook. Could have followed. Could have tried. You said stay. Stayed. Cardinal gone. Sorry? You're sorry?*

You don't answer. There's nothing to say. Rook is right.

---

## FAILURE: WATCHED THEM GO

**Cardinal:** Transferred to unknown location. Trail cold. Gone.
**Rook:** Obeyed orders. Watched the vehicle leave. Carries the weight of not following.
**You:** Chose safety over action. The safe choice lost Cardinal.

You watched them go. That's the truth of it. Rook had eyes on Cardinal being loaded into a vehicle, and you said stay. You said safe. You said we'll find them again.

You won't find them again. They're professionals. They don't make the same mistake twice. The building is empty, the trail is cold, and Cardinal is somewhere north in a vehicle you can't trace.

Patience was the strategy. Patience became paralysis.

---

```limn
pat vir | pat vic | dif unk | you cho wro one
```

*Patience virtue. Patience vice. Difference unknown. You chose wrong one.*

---

```limn
saf kep | car los | roo saf | you saf | saf wor not
```

*Safety kept. Cardinal lost. Rook safe. You safe. Safety worth nothing.*

```limn
opp com onc | dor ope onc | veh sta onc | you say wai | opp gon
```

*Opportunity comes once. Door opens once. Vehicle starts once. You said wait. Opportunity gone.*

```limn
wat the go | you job | you cho | you fai | wat cos all
```

*Watched them go. Your job. Your choice. Your failure. Watching cost all.*

```limn
nex tim act | nex tim fol | nex tim ris | but nu nex tim | car gon
```

*Next time act. Next time follow. Next time risk. But no next time. Cardinal gone.*
