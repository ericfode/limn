# ENDING: Isolation Fails

You sent:

```limn
roo mov | bis sta hid | com sep | nu dir con | you coo
```

> *Rook moves. Bishop stays hidden. Compartments separate. No direct contact. You coordinate.*

You are the only bridge. Neither asset knows the other exists. Perfect security. Fatal flaw.

---

## Hour 14:00

Shift change begins. Rook moves.

```limn
roo | mov ins | beh ent | bas rou | ins
```

> *Rook. Moving inside. Rear entry. Basement route. Inside.*

You confirm with Bishop:

```limn
bis | shi cha con | gua mov | win ope | roo cle
```

> *Bishop. Shift change confirmed. Guards moving. Window open. Rook is clear.*

Bishop doesn't know Rook's name. Doesn't know Rook's face. Only knows "the operator" is moving.

---

## Hour 14:05

Rook advances through the basement. Bishop reports from outside.

```limn
roo | bas cle | sta up | lev 1
```

> *Rook. Basement clear. Stairs up. Level 1.*

```limn
bis | urj | gua mov int | one gua lev 1 wes | war ope
```

> *Bishop. Urgent. Guard moving interior. One guard level 1 west. Warn operator.*

You relay to Rook:

```limn
roo | gua lev 1 wes | avo | go eas
```

> *Rook. Guard level 1 west. Avoid. Go east.*

The relay works. You pass information between two people who don't know each other. Clean. Controlled.

---

## Hour 14:10

Then Bishop sends something unexpected:

```limn
bis | urj | mov ins | see opp | mus ver | ent bui
```

> *Bishop. Urgent. Moving inside. See opportunity. Must verify. Entering building.*

Your heart stops. Bishop was supposed to stay outside. Eyes only. But Bishop has entered the building.

```limn
bis | neg | sta out | ord | nu ent | com bre
```

> *Bishop. Negative. Stay outside. Order. Do not enter. Compartment breach.*

```limn
bis | sor | alr ins | fro ent | lev 1 | see thi | ver qui | ret soo
```

> *Bishop. Sorry. Already inside. Front entry. Level 1. See something. Verify quickly. Return soon.*

Two assets are now inside the same building. Neither knows the other is there. You are the only person who knows both positions.

---

## Hour 14:12

Rook is moving east on level 1. Bishop entered from the front and is moving interior on level 1.

They are converging.

```limn
roo | lev 1 eas hal | mov nor | qui
```

> *Rook. Level 1 east hallway. Moving north. Quiet.*

```limn
bis | lev 1 | mov eas | che roo | ver int
```

> *Bishop. Level 1. Moving east. Checking rooms. Verifying interior.*

Moving east. Both of them. Same hallway. Same floor. You type as fast as you can:

```limn
roo | sto | hol pos | urj | sto now
```

> *Rook. Stop. Hold position. Urgent. Stop now.*

```limn
bis | sto | ret out | urj | sto now
```

> *Bishop. Stop. Return outside. Urgent. Stop now.*

---

## Hour 14:13

Too late.

```limn
roo | urj | con unk | per int | ene te age te | unk | fig
```

> *Rook. Urgent. Contact unknown. Person interior. Enemy or agent? Unknown. Fighting.*

```limn
bis | urj | att | per att me | ene | fig
```

> *Bishop. Urgent. Attack. Person attacked me. Enemy. Fighting.*

They found each other. In the dark, in a hostile building, two people who don't know each other met in a hallway. They did what trained operatives do when they encounter the unknown.

They fought.

---

## Hour 14:14

```limn
roo | dow ene | sub | gua hea | ala | ala | gua com
```

> *Rook. Downed enemy. Subdued. Guards heard. Alarm. Alarm. Guards coming.*

```limn
bis | hit | inj | per sub me | gua ala | tra | run
```

> *Bishop. Hit. Injured. Person subdued me. Guards alerted. Trapped. Running.*

The noise of their fight triggered the alarm. Guards converge. The building locks down.

You send to both, knowing it's too late:

```limn
urj | you fig eac oth | bis roo sam sid | sto fig | sto
```

> *Urgent. You fought each other. Bishop and Rook same side. Stop fighting. Stop.*

---

## Hour 14:16

```limn
roo | wh | bis | wh bis | you sen two | ene eve whe | tra | gua com
```

> *Rook. What? Bishop? What Bishop? You sent two? Enemy everywhere. Trapped. Guards coming.*

```limn
bis | roo | ope is roo | you nev say | inj | can nu mov fas | gua clo
```

> *Bishop. Rook? Operator is Rook? You never said. Injured. Cannot move fast. Guards closing.*

The accusation in both messages. You never told them. That was the point. Compartments. Security. Need-to-know.

They didn't need to know. Until they did.

---

## Hour 14:20

```limn
roo | gua 6 | sur | can nu fig | cap | sor han | you fai
```

> *Rook. Six guards. Surrounded. Cannot fight. Captured. Sorry handler. You failed.*

```limn
bis | cap | inj leg | gua hol | roo cap too | car sti hel | all fai | com fai
```

> *Bishop. Captured. Injured leg. Guards holding. Rook captured too. Cardinal still held. All failed. Compartments failed.*

Silence. Both channels go dark.

---

## FAILURE: ISOLATION FAILS

**Cardinal:** Still held. Never reached.
**Rook:** Captured. Fought an ally in the dark.
**Bishop:** Captured. Injured by an ally they never knew existed.
**You:** Over-compartmentalized. Your security became their blindness.

They didn't fail. You failed them. You kept them so separate that they couldn't recognize each other as allies. Your walls became their cage.

---

```limn
com pro | com iso | iso bli | bli fig | fig ala | ala fai
```

*Compartments protect. Compartments isolate. Isolation blinds. Blindness fights. Fighting alarms. Alarm: failure.*

---

```limn
sec kep the saf | sec kep the apa | apa mad the ene | ene mad the los
```

*Security kept them safe. Security kept them apart. Apart made them enemies. Enemies made them lost.*

```limn
bis nev kno roo | roo nev kno bis | bot kno ene | bot wro
```

*Bishop never knew Rook. Rook never knew Bishop. Both knew enemy. Both wrong.*

```limn
you bri | you onl bri | bri too slo | bri too nar | bri bro
```

*You: the bridge. You: the only bridge. Bridge too slow. Bridge too narrow. Bridge broke.*

```limn
dar hal | two sha | two fig | sam sid | nev kno | com kil
```

*Dark hallway. Two shadows. Two fought. Same side. Never knew. Compartments killed.*

**THE END**
