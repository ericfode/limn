# ENDING: Isolation Fails

Without direct contact, the team collided.

```limn
bis roo | nu kno eac | col | ala | all los
```

> Bishop, Rook. Neither knew each other. Collision. Alarm. All lost.

## FAILURE: ISOLATION FAILS

**Cardinal:** Still held.
**Bishop:** Captured.
**Rook:** Captured.
**Cause:** Over-compartmentalization.

```limn
iso fai | coo nec | sec cos
```

*Isolation failed. Coordination necessary. Security cost too high.*
