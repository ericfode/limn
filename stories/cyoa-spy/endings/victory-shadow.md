# ENDING: Shadow Play

You sent:

```limn
arc | int ter | con neg | det wan | rep bac | tim tak
```

> *Architect. Interested in terms. Continue negotiation. Want details. Respond back. Taking time.*

Keep them talking. Ten more minutes. Just ten.

---

## Hour 14:16

The Architect responds with elaborate terms:

```limn
arc | ter det | car for you | inf for car | net sta for sil | te acc
```

> Architect. Terms detailed. Cardinal for you. Information for Cardinal. Network stability for silence. Accept?

You pretend to consider. You ask clarifying questions. You drag it out.

---

## Hour 14:20

```limn
cla nec | you mea sel | sel wh | bod te min | det req
```

> Clarification needed. "You" means self? Self what? Body or mind? Details required.

The Architect explains. Every message is another minute. Every explanation is another step your team takes toward the exit.

---

## Hour 14:25

Bishop sends:

```limn
bis | out | car out | roo out | cle | mis suc
```

> Bishop. Outside. Cardinal outside. Rook outside. Clear. Mission success.

They made it.

---

## Hour 14:26

You send one last message to the Architect:

```limn
arc | ter rej | alt acc | alt | tha for tim | goo
```

> Architect. Terms rejected. Alternative accepted. Alternative: [nothing]. Thanks for the time. Goodbye.

You log off.

## The Magic Trick

The Architect spent twenty-six minutes negotiating with you.

In those twenty-six minutes, Bishop and Rook walked Cardinal out the back door.

The greatest trick isn't making something disappear. It's making someone look the other way.

---

## VICTORY: SHADOW PLAY

**Cardinal:** Rescued. While the Architect watched you.
**Bishop:** Executed perfectly. Silent. Professional.
**Rook:** Covered the retreat. Flawless.
**The Architect:** Outplayed. Humiliated.
**You:** Proved that words are weapons.

Misdirection won. The conversation was the mission.

```limn
wor wea | tal dis | act hid | vic sha | arc out
```

*Words weapon. Talk distracts. Action hidden. Victory in shadow. Architect outplayed.*

---

```limn
mag old | eye fro | han beh | aud see wh wan | tru els
```

*Magic old. Eyes front. Hands behind. Audience sees what's wanted. Truth elsewhere.*

```limn
you tal | the mov | you ask | the tak | you neg | the win
```

*You talked. They moved. You asked. They took. You negotiated. They won.*

```limn
arc thi pla you | you pla arc | wh pla wh | mir ref mir
```

*Architect thought playing you. You played Architect. Who plays who? Mirrors reflecting mirrors.*

```limn
end | car hom | net sta | han bre | sha smi
```

*Ending. Cardinal home. Network stands. Handler breathes. Shadow smiles.*
