# ENDING: Signal Intercepted

You sent:

```limn
urj | cha int | ene hea all | loc com | tra
```

> *Urgent. Channel intercepted. Enemy heard all. Location compromised. Trap.*

But you sent it too late.

---

## Hour 24:35

Rook is already in position. Bishop is already moving. Knight is already broadcasting building layout on the open channel.

And the Architect has been listening to every word.

```limn
arc | tha you | loc con | age loc con | all loc con | wel
```

> *Architect. Thank you. Location confirmed. Agents' locations confirmed. All locations confirmed. Welcome.*

The message arrives on your screen like ice water. They heard everything. Breaking dark didn't just reunite your network—it lit it up for the enemy.

---

## Hour 24:40

You send the abort:

```limn
all age | abo | abo | cha com | ext imm | sca
```

> *All agents. Abort. Abort. Channel compromised. Extract immediately. Scatter.*

Rook responds first:

```limn
roo | abo rec | mov to ext | blo | ene pos all ext | tra
```

> *Rook. Abort received. Moving to extract. Blocked. Enemy positioned at all exits. Trapped.*

---

## Hour 24:45

Bishop:

```limn
bis | sur | thr sid | nu ext | the wai for | the kno
```

> *Bishop. Surrounded. Three sides. No extraction. They were waiting. They knew.*

Knight:

```limn
kni | run | pur | the kno my loc | how | cha | the hea cha
```

> *Knight. Running. Pursuit. They knew my location. How? Channel. They heard channel.*

How. Knight asks how. You know how. You broke dark. You told everyone to share locations. And the enemy was on the line, writing it all down.

---

## Hour 25

One by one, the transmissions stop.

Rook:

```limn
roo | cor | nu way | the—
```

> *Rook. Cornered. No way out. They—*

Bishop:

```limn
bis | tak | sor han | tru you | my mis
```

> *Bishop. Taken. Sorry handler. Trusted you. My mistake.*

That last message burns. Bishop trusted you. Bishop's mistake was trusting you.

---

## Hour 25:30

Knight holds out longest. Still running. Still transmitting:

```limn
kni | sti mov | pur clo | ene 4 | nu hel com | acc
```

> *Knight. Still moving. Pursuit closing. Enemy four. No help coming. Accepted.*

Then:

```limn
kni | sto | don | the her | sav str | nu poi
```

> *Knight. Stopped. Done. They're here. Save strength. No point.*

Silence.

---

## Hour 26

You sit alone. Every channel dead. Every agent gone.

The Architect sends one final message. Not in Limn—in plain text, because the pretense is over:

```limn
arc | you uni the | you gat the | you del the | tha han | car say hel
```

> *Architect. You united them. You gathered them. You delivered them. Thank you, handler. Cardinal says hello.*

---

## Hour 27

You try every channel. Every frequency. Every backup protocol. Dead air. Every one.

```limn
you | cal | any | ans | pls | any age | sig | any sig
```

> *You. Calling. Anyone. Answer. Please. Any agent. Signal. Any signal.*

The only answer is the hum of equipment waiting for voices that won't come.

---

## FAILURE: SIGNAL INTERCEPTED

**Rook:** Captured at extraction point. Enemy was already there.
**Bishop:** Surrounded. Taken. Last words were an apology for trusting you.
**Knight:** Ran the longest. Stopped when it was pointless.
**Cardinal:** Still held. Now has company.
**Network:** Destroyed. Every asset burned in a single transmission.
**You:** Broke dark. Reunited the team. Handed them all to the enemy on an open channel.

Darkness was isolation. Darkness was silence. Darkness was safe.

You chose light. And light showed the enemy exactly where to aim.

---

```limn
dar saf | dar lon | you hat dar | you bro dar | dar was rig
```

*Dark was safe. Dark was lonely. You hated dark. You broke dark. Dark was right.*

---

```limn
tea tog str | tea tog vis | str and vis | ene see str | ene tak str
```

*Team together is strong. Team together is visible. Strong and visible. Enemy sees strength. Enemy takes strength.*

```limn
you sen loc | the rec loc | you sen pla | the rec pla | you giv all
```

*You sent locations. They received locations. You sent plan. They received plan. You gave them everything.*

```limn
bis say tru you | bis say my mis | wor you hea | wor you ear | wor you des
```

*Bishop said trusted you. Bishop said my mistake. Worst words you heard. Worst words you earned. Worst words you deserved.*

```limn
sil bef | sil aft | dif sil | bef sil ful | now sil emp
```

*Silence before. Silence after. Different silence. Before: silence was full. Now: silence is empty.*
