# ENDING: Trust Deficit

You sent:

```limn
bis | roo | bot not | tru iss | te coo | dif
```

> *Bishop. Rook. Both noticed. Trust issues. Coordinate? Difficult.*

They know. Both of them know you don't trust either of them.

And now everything breaks down.

---

## Hour 12

Bishop responds:

```limn
bis | not | par tru not eno | ful coo nec | giv te lea
```

> Bishop. Noted. Partial trust not enough. Full cooperation necessary. Give or leave.

Bishop is issuing an ultimatum. Trust them fully or they walk.

---

## Hour 13

Rook responds:

```limn
roo | und | you tes me | you tes bis | you tru nu one | wh poi
```

> Rook. Understood. You tested me. You tested Bishop. You trust no one. What's the point?

Rook sees the pattern. You've tested everyone. You trust no one. And they're asking: why work for a handler who doesn't believe in them?

---

## Hour 14

You try to coordinate anyway:

```limn
we ext pla | bis int | roo act | coo req | car tim sho
```

> Imperative: Extraction plan. Bishop intelligence. Rook action. Coordination required. Cardinal time short.

No response from Bishop.

Rook:
```limn
roo | wai bis | nu mov alo | tea te alo
```

> Rook. Waiting for Bishop. Not moving alone. Team or alone?

They won't act without trust. Without team cohesion. Your paranoia paralyzed them.

---

## Hour 24

Cardinal's window is half gone. Your team is fragmented. No one moves.

---

## Hour 48

Cardinal breaks.

```limn
arc | car bro | you net kno | par tru kil you | tha
```

> Architect. Cardinal broken. Know your network. Partial trust killed you. Thanks.

---

## ENDING: TRUST DEFICIT

**Cardinal:** Broken. Information extracted.
**Bishop:** Abandoned you. Can't blame them.
**Rook:** Refused to act without team. Can't blame them either.
**Network:** Compromised. Your fault.
**You:** Trusted no one. Got what you earned.

Paranoia is a form of prophecy. Assume betrayal long enough, and you create it.

---

```limn
tru nu | tea nu | act nu | los all | par poi sel
```

*Trust none. Team none. Action none. Lost all. Paranoia poisons self.*

**THE END**
