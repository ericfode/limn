Knight, watching from outside:

```limn

## The Sacrifice

Knight was supposed to stay safe. You ordered it.

Knight disobeyed. Knight saved everyone.

Knight is gone.

---

## ENDING: KNIGHT'S PRICE

**Cardinal:** Rescued. Safe.
**Rook:** Safe. Alive because of Knight.
**Knight:** Missing. Probably captured. Possibly dead.
**You:** Saved two. Lost one. The math doesn't feel like victory.

Knight wasn't supposed to be in the field. They weren't supposed to matter.

They mattered most.

```limn

```

*Order given. Order broken. Sacrifice made. Sacrifice's price. Mission success?*

---

```limn
kni ret | kni civ | kni nu sol | kni cho bec sol aga
```

*Knight retired. Knight civilian. Knight not soldier. Knight chose to become soldier again.*

```limn

```

*You said stay safe. Knight heard. Knight ignored. Knight saved.*

```limn
som vic cos | som los giv | som mat mor | kni mat mos
```

*Some victories cost. Some losses give. Some matter more. Knight mattered most.*

```limn

```

*Where Knight now? Running still? Captured? Gone? Answer none. Answer never.*

```limn

```

*You remember. You owe. You carry. Knight knows.*
