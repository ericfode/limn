# ENDING: Network United

You sent:

```limn
tea | ext suc | car saf | all saf | net wor
```

> *Team. Extraction successful. Cardinal safe. All safe. Network worked.*

But first—the hours that earned it.

---

## Hour 25

The network moves as one. For the first time since Cardinal was taken, every piece is on the board.

Bishop takes overwatch—high position, eyes on the perimeter:

```limn
bis | pos hig | vis ful per | gua cou | 6 ext | 2 roo | rot 15m
```

> *Bishop. Position high. Full perimeter visible. Guard count: 6 exterior. 2 rooftop. Rotation every 15 minutes.*

Knight maps the approach from memory, corrected by Bishop's live intelligence:

```limn
kni | eas ent bes | bis con gua gap 15m mar | win ope 3m
```

> *Knight. East entrance best. Bishop confirms guard gap at 15 minute mark. Window opens 3 minutes.*

Rook is ready:

```limn
roo | eas ent | pos | wai gap | rea
```

> *Rook. East entrance. In position. Waiting for gap. Ready.*

Three agents. Three roles. One handler holding it together. You.

---

## Hour 25:15

Bishop calls the gap:

```limn
bis | gap now | gua eas mov nor | 3m | roo go
```

> *Bishop. Gap now. East guard moving north. 3 minutes. Rook go.*

```limn
roo | mov | ins | qui | fol kni dir
```

> *Rook. Moving. Inside. Quiet. Following Knight's directions.*

Knight guides from outside, relaying through you:

```limn
kni | bas cor | rig | sta up | lev 2 | las dor rig | car the
```

> *Knight. Basement corridor. Right. Stairs up. Level 2. Last door right. Cardinal there.*

---

## Hour 25:20

```limn
roo | lev 2 | las dor | loc 2 gua | nec dis
```

> *Rook. Level 2. Last door. 2 guards at location. Need distraction.*

You don't even have to ask. Bishop is already moving:

```limn
bis | dis rea | fir ala nor win | pul now | gua wil res
```

> *Bishop. Distraction ready. Fire alarm north wing. Pulling now. Guards will respond.*

The alarm screams through the building. Both guards leave their post—protocol, respond to fire alarm, Cardinal isn't going anywhere.

Except Cardinal is.

```limn
roo | gua gon | dor ope | car fou | ali | ext now
```

> *Rook. Guards gone. Door open. Cardinal found. Alive. Extracting now.*

---

## Hour 25:25

Cardinal on Rook's shoulder, moving fast through a building emptying toward the false alarm:

```limn
roo | mov dow | car wea but mov | sta dow | bas | eas ext
```

> *Rook. Moving down. Cardinal weak but moving. Stairs down. Basement. East exit.*

Bishop from overwatch:

```limn
bis | eas cle | gua all nor | win ope | go now
```

> *Bishop. East clear. Guards all north. Window open. Go now.*

Knight, waiting at the east lot with the engine running:

```limn
kni | car rea | vis eas dor | see the | com | com now
```

> *Knight. Car ready. Visual on east door. See them. Come. Come now.*

---

## Hour 25:28

Rook and Cardinal burst through the east door. Knight pulls the car forward. Bishop is already descending from the overwatch point, moving to secondary vehicle.

```limn
roo | car in veh | kni dri | mov | ext cle
```

> *Rook. Cardinal in vehicle. Knight driving. Moving. Extraction clean.*

```limn
bis | sec veh | fol | cov rea | all out
```

> *Bishop. Secondary vehicle. Following. Cover ready. All out.*

---

## Hour 26

Two cars. Four agents. One Cardinal. Highway, heading away from the building that held everything you cared about.

Cardinal, barely conscious, manages:

```limn
car | all her | all cam | how
```

> *Cardinal. All here. All came. How?*

You answer:

```limn
han | dar bro | net reu | tea cam | bec tea
```

> *Handler. Dark broken. Network reunited. Team came. Because team.*

---

## Hour 27

Safe house. Cardinal on a bed, IV drip, color returning. Knight boils water for tea. Rook checks the perimeter one more time. Bishop is already encoding the after-action report.

The network is intact. Every agent accounted for. Cardinal home.

```limn
all | sta rep | saf | saf | saf | saf | saf
```

> *All. Status report. Safe. Safe. Safe. Safe. Safe.*

Five safes. One for each of them.

---

## VICTORY: NETWORK UNITED

**Cardinal:** Rescued. Recovering. Surrounded by every agent who refused to give up.
**Rook:** Operator. Extracted Cardinal cleanly while the building chased a ghost alarm.
**Bishop:** Eyes and distraction. Saw everything, confused everyone.
**Knight:** Memory and wheels. Mapped the route, drove the escape.
**You:** Broke the dark. Trusted the network. The network trusted back.

You spent days in silence, operating alone, carrying the weight of every decision. Then you opened the channel and let them in.

They came. All of them.

---

```limn
dar end | net reu | car sav | vic tog | tog key
```

*Darkness ended. Network reunited. Cardinal saved. Victory together. Together was the key.*

---

```limn
sol you str | sol you wea | tea you str | tea you ris | wor it
```

*Solo: you're strong. Solo: you're weak. Team: you're stronger. Team: you risk more. Worth it.*

```limn
bis eye | roo han | kni mem | you voi | car rea | all nec | non eno alo
```

*Bishop: eyes. Rook: hands. Knight: memory. You: voice. Cardinal: reason. All necessary. None enough alone.*

```limn
you bro dar | you ris all | you tru tea | tea tru you | tru win
```

*You broke dark. You risked all. You trusted team. Team trusted you. Trust won.*

```limn
net bro | net hea | net str now | bro pla hea str | alw
```

*Network broke. Network healed. Network stronger now. Broken places heal strongest. Always.*
