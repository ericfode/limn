# ENDING: Home Ground

You sent:

```limn
we acc | kni lea | roo fol | bui you kno | ext car | god spe
```

> *Imperative: Accept. Knight leads. Rook follows. Building you know. Extract Cardinal. Godspeed.*

Knight goes back inside. Back to a building they know better than their own home.

---

## Hour 20

Knight leads:

```limn
kni | ins | hal rem | dor cha | bas ent kno | fol
```

> Knight. Inside. Hallway remembered. Doors changed. Basement entry known. Following.

The building has changed since Knight worked there. But the bones are the same. The basement entrance that was never on any blueprint—Knight knows where it is.

---

## Hour 20:15

```limn
bas | old rou | pip tun | lev 2 acc | car nea
```

> Basement. Old route. Pipe tunnel. Level 2 access. Cardinal near.

Knight is navigating through maintenance tunnels. Paths that security doesn't watch because security doesn't know they exist.

---

## Hour 20:20

Rook follows:

```limn
roo | kni gui per | nu gua see | car dor ahe | qui
```

> Rook. Knight guiding perfectly. No guards seen. Cardinal's door ahead. Quiet.

---

## Hour 20:25

```limn
dor ope | car ins | ali | wea | mov | ext rou
```

> Door open. Cardinal inside. Alive. Weak. Moving. Extraction route.

---

## Hour 20:35

```limn
ext | sam rou | bas | out | cle | mis suc
```

> Extracting. Same route. Basement. Outside. Clear. Mission success.

They came in through the basement. They went out the same way. The guards never knew anyone was there.

---

## The Old Hand

Knight remembered everything. Every corridor, every tunnel, every secret the building tried to hide.

Some things you don't forget. Some skills don't fade.

Knight proved that tonight.

---

## VICTORY: HOME GROUND

**Cardinal:** Rescued. Weak but alive.
**Knight:** Returned to form. Every memory intact.
**Rook:** Witnessed something rare. Learning.
**Network:** Intact. Strengthened.
**You:** Found treasure in an old asset.

Local knowledge beat surveillance. Memory beat technology.

---

```limn
loc win | mem win | old ski new use | hom alw hom
```

*Local wins. Memory wins. Old skills, new use. Home is always home.*
