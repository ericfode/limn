# ENDING: One Against Many

You sent:

```limn
roo | gua dow | ala | ene con | hel
```

> *Rook. Guard down. Alarm. Enemy converging. Help.*

The guard went down. But not quietly enough.

---

## Hour 20:12

The alarm splits the night open. Red lights. Sirens. The building wakes up.

```limn
roo | ins | ala tri | gua dow 1 | gua 2 see | ala pul | ene com
```

> Rook. Inside. Alarm triggered. Guard 1 down. Guard 2 saw. Alarm pulled. Enemy coming.

One guard neutralized. The second saw it happen and reached the alarm panel. Two seconds was all it took.

Rook is inside a hostile building that now knows they're there.

---

## Hour 20:14

```limn
roo | mov lev 2 | car mus fin | ala no mat | mis sti | mov
```

> Rook. Moving level 2. Cardinal must find. Alarm no matter. Mission still. Moving.

Rook isn't retreating. They're pushing deeper.

```limn
roo neg | ext now | aba | too man | ord ret
```

> *Rook negative. Extract now. Abandon. Too many. Order: return.*

---

## Hour 20:15

```limn
roo | neg | car clo | wil nu lea | mov
```

> Rook. Negative. Cardinal close. Will not leave. Moving.

Rook refuses your order. You sent them in alone. Now they won't come out alone either.

---

## Hour 20:18

```limn
roo | lev 2 | hal | gua 3 | dow 2 | inj | arm gra | mov
```

> Rook. Level 2. Hallway. Guards 3. Down 2. Injured. Arm grazed. Moving.

Three guards in the hallway. Rook took down two. Got hurt. Kept moving.

One agent against a building. The math is simple and brutal.

---

## Hour 20:20

```limn
roo | roo 3 | dor | car ins | hea car | dor loc | hvy | no key
```

> Rook. Room 3. Door. Cardinal inside. Hear Cardinal. Door locked. Heavy. No key.

Rook reached Cardinal's room. The door is between them. Close enough to hear Cardinal's voice through the wall.

```limn
roo | gua com beh | 4 | fac dor | no ext | sta fig
```

> Rook. Guards coming behind. Four. Facing door. No exit. Standing to fight.

Four guards at their back. A locked door in front. Cardinal on the other side, unreachable.

---

## Hour 20:23

```limn
roo | fig | dow 1 | dow 2 | hit | hit aga | sti sta
```

> Rook. Fighting. Down 1. Down 2. Hit. Hit again. Still standing.

Impacts. Grunts. A shout. Rook is fighting four guards in a narrow corridor, wounded, alone.

---

## Hour 20:24

```limn
roo | dow | the hav | sor | car sti loc | fai | sor han
```

> Rook. Down. They have me. Sorry. Cardinal still locked. Failed. Sorry handler.

Rook is down. Captured. The corridor is quiet again.

Behind the locked door, Cardinal didn't even know rescue was inches away.

---

## Hour 21

```limn
arc | you | 2 now | roo joi car | pri ris | cho bad han
```

> Architect. You. Have two now. Rook joins Cardinal. Price rising. Bad choices handler.

The Architect has both of them now. Rook sent in alone, captured alone.

Bad choices, the Architect says. They're right.

---

## FAILURE: ONE AGAINST MANY

**Rook:** Captured. Fought through half the building alone. Wasn't enough.
**Cardinal:** Still held. Door still locked. Security now impenetrable.
**Bishop:** Safe outside. Could have helped. Wasn't sent.
**You:** Sent one person to do what needed two. Watched them fall.

Rook fought. Two guards in the hallway. Two more at the door. Wounded, outnumbered, alone.

They got to Cardinal's door. Close enough to hear them through the wall. Not close enough.

You had Bishop. You kept Bishop back. You thought one was enough.

One was not enough.

---

```limn
sol bra | sol foo | one age | one bui | num alw win | alw
```

*Solo brave. Solo foolish. One agent. One building. Numbers always win. Always.*

---

```limn
roo fig | roo bra | roo alo | roo fal | bra nu eno | nev eno alo
```

*Rook fought. Rook brave. Rook alone. Rook fell. Brave not enough. Never enough alone.*

```limn
bis out | bis saf | bis use | you kep bac | wh cos | roo cos
```

*Bishop outside. Bishop safe. Bishop useless. You kept back. What cost? Rook cost.*

```limn
dor loc | car beh | roo fro | clo eno hea | too far sav
```

*Door locked. Cardinal behind. Rook in front. Close enough to hear. Too far to save.*

```limn
han cho | han sen one | han los one | one aga man | man win
```

*Handler chose. Handler sent one. Handler lost one. One against many. Many win.*
