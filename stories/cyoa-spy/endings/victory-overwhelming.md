# ENDING: Overwhelming Force

You sent:

```limn
ext cle | all out | car saf | mis suc | tea wor
```

> *Extraction clear. All out. Cardinal safe. Mission success. Team worked.*

Three assets. One target. Total coordination. This is what a network is for.

---

## Hour 9:00

The synchronization is perfect. Three confirmations, three seconds apart:

```limn
bis | mov fro | gua 2 | rea
```

> *Bishop. Moving front. Two guards. Ready.*

```limn
kni | mov beh | loa doc | cle | rea
```

> *Knight. Moving rear. Loading dock. Clear. Ready.*

```limn
roo | pos roo | eye all | sup rea | syn con
```

> *Rook. Positioned rooftop. Eyes on all. Support ready. Sync confirmed.*

You breathe. You give the word:

```limn
we go | now | syn
```

> *Imperative: Go. Now. Synchronized.*

---

## Hour 9:03

Bishop hits the front. Two guards. They don't have time to radio.

```limn
bis | fro bre | gua dow | qui | ins | mov lev 1
```

> *Bishop. Front breached. Guards down. Quiet. Inside. Moving level 1.*

Knight enters through the rear. No resistance. The rear was unguarded because Bishop drew attention forward.

```limn
kni | beh ins | cle | mov lev 2 | sta rou
```

> *Knight. Rear inside. Clear. Moving level 2. Stairwell route.*

Rook feeds you everything from above:

```limn
roo | vis | bis lev 1 | kni lev 2 | gua 2 lev 2 hal | kni cle lef
```

> *Rook. Visual. Bishop level 1. Knight level 2. Two guards level 2 hallway. Knight clear if left.*

You relay to Knight:

```limn
kni | gua 2 rig hal | go lef | qui
```

> *Knight. Two guards right hallway. Go left. Quiet.*

---

## Hour 9:06

Knight reaches Cardinal's room. Bishop holds level 1, blocking any reinforcement from below.

```limn
kni | car roo | doo loc | ski ope
```

> *Knight. Cardinal's room. Door locked. Working to open.*

```limn
bis | lev 1 hol | gua 3 dow tot | flo sec
```

> *Bishop. Level 1 held. Three guards down total. Floor secure.*

Rook spots movement outside:

```limn
roo | veh app | 2 min | ene rel te pat | mov fas
```

> *Rook. Vehicle approaching. Two minutes. Enemy relief or patrol. Move fast.*

You relay:

```limn
kni | 2 min | ext now | urj
```

> *Knight. Two minutes. Extract now. Urgent.*

---

## Hour 9:08

```limn
kni | doo ope | car fou | ali | wea te ali | ext now
```

> *Knight. Door open. Cardinal found. Alive. Weak but alive. Extracting now.*

```limn
bis | lev 1 hol sti | pat cle | kni ext
```

> *Bishop. Level 1 held still. Path clear. Knight extract.*

Knight brings Cardinal down the stairwell. Bishop covers. Rook watches the approaching vehicle.

```limn
roo | veh 1 min | ene 4 | arm | ext beh now | win clo
```

> *Rook. Vehicle one minute. Enemy four. Armed. Extract rear now. Window closing.*

---

## Hour 9:10

Knight and Cardinal reach the rear loading dock. Bishop disengages and follows.

```limn
kni | car out | beh ext | bis fol
```

> *Knight. Cardinal out. Rear exit. Bishop following.*

```limn
bis | out | all cle | mov ext poi
```

> *Bishop. Out. All clear. Moving extraction point.*

```limn
roo | ene veh arr | ene ent fro | too lat | you cle | go
```

> *Rook. Enemy vehicle arrived. Enemy entering front. Too late for them. You're clear. Go.*

The enemy walks into an empty building. Every asset is already gone.

---

## Hour 9:15

Three confirmations. Clean. Fast. Perfect.

```limn
bis | ext poi | saf
```

> *Bishop. Extraction point. Safe.*

```limn
kni | ext poi | car wit | saf
```

> *Knight. Extraction point. Cardinal with. Safe.*

```limn
roo | dis | mov | saf | all saf
```

> *Rook. Disengaging. Moving. Safe. All safe.*

You sit back. Nine minutes inside the building. Zero casualties on your side. Cardinal alive.

This is what three assets, one handler, and perfect coordination looks like.

---

## VICTORY: OVERWHELMING FORCE

**Cardinal:** Rescued. Alive. Recovering.
**Bishop:** Front breach, floor control, clean exit. Flawless.
**Knight:** Rear entry, extraction, Cardinal secured. Flawless.
**Rook:** Overwatch, real-time intelligence, timing. Flawless.
**You:** Coordination. Relay. Timing. The hand that moved the pieces.

Three moved as one. The enemy never had a chance.

---

```limn
tea mov one | han gui all | ene los bef kno | vic tot | vic sha
```

*Team moved as one. Handler guided all. Enemy lost before they knew. Total victory. Shared victory.*

---

```limn
bis str | kni ski | roo eye | you wor | tea wor | all wor
```

*Bishop: strength. Knight: skill. Rook: eyes. You: words. Team: work. All worked.*

```limn
syn mea tru | thr age one tim | one sig one mov | per
```

*Synchronize means trust. Three agents one time. One signal one movement. Perfect.*

```limn
num mat | ski mat | tea mat mos | one age bra | thr age arm
```

*Numbers matter. Skill matters. Team matters most. One agent: brave. Three agents: an army.*

```limn
car saf | tea saf | net pro | you pro | vic how vic sho be
```

*Cardinal safe. Team safe. Network proven. You proven. Victory how victory should be.*
