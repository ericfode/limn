# ENDING: Into the Trap

You sent:

```limn
we mov ins | fin ent | ris acc | car may ins
```

> *Imperative: Move inside. Find entry. Risk accepted. Cardinal may be inside.*

Rook doesn't hesitate. They've been following for hours. They want this to mean something.

---

## Hour 12

```limn
ent fou | sid dor | ins | dar | mov slo
```

> Entry found. Side door. Inside. Dark. Moving slow.

Rook is in. An industrial building, minimal lighting, echoing spaces.

---

## Hour 12:10

```limn
hal | dor man | nu sig car | sea
```

> Hallway. Many doors. No sign of Cardinal. Searching.

---

## Hour 12:20

```limn
roo emp | roo emp | roo emp | nu car | te wh
```

> Room empty. Room empty. Room empty. No Cardinal. What?

The vehicle came here. But there's nothing here. Empty rooms. No guards. No prisoners.

---

## Hour 12:25

```limn
urj | dor beh loc | nu exi | tra | tra | sor
```

> Urgent. Door behind locked. No exit. Trap. Trap. Sorry.

The last message.

---

## Hour 13

Nothing.

---

## Hour 14

```limn
arc | tha fol | roo hav | car too | te tra
```

> Architect. Thanks for following. Have Rook. Have Cardinal too. Two for trade?

The vehicle was bait. The building was a trap. They wanted you to follow, and you did.

Now they have both.

---

## The Architect's Game

They never moved Cardinal at all. They sent an empty vehicle, waited to see if anyone followed, and prepared the trap.

You chased the shadow. The shadow was the trap.

---

## FAILURE: INTO THE TRAP

**Cardinal:** Still in original location. Or moved elsewhere. Unknown.
**Rook:** Captured. Location unknown.
**Network:** Exposed. The enemy knows your methods.
**You:** Outplayed.

The Architect is better at this than you are. They think three moves ahead. You think one.

```limn
tra set | tra spr | fol los | lea win | les unk
```

*Trap set. Trap sprung. Follower lost. Leader wins. Lesson unknown.*

**THE END**
