# ENDING: Asking Around

You sent:

```limn
roo con | dee pro | mor loc | mor que | bui det nee | go
```

> *Rook: continue. Deeper probe. More locals. More questions. Building details needed. Go.*

More questions. More people. More chances for someone to talk to the wrong person.

---

## Hour 17

Rook pushes deeper. The coffee shop owner gave good intelligence. The security guard gave better. Now Rook wants more.

```limn
roo | tal har sto own | bui del eve | tru loa | wh ins | she kno
```

> *Rook. Talked hardware store owner. Building deliveries every evening. Truck loads. What's inside? She knows.*

The hardware store owner is helpful. Too helpful. She talks freely about the building, the trucks, the strange men who come and go.

You should have wondered why she talked so freely.

---

## Hour 18

```limn
roo | tal str ven | sel foo out bui | see ins | gua buy foo | num gua | 12
```

> *Rook. Talked street vendor. Sells food outside building. Sees inside. Guards buy food. Number of guards: 12.*

Twelve guards. Valuable intelligence. Rook is building a complete picture--schedules, numbers, delivery patterns.

But Rook is also building a pattern of their own. A stranger asking questions. Shop to shop. Vendor to vendor. In a neighborhood where strangers get noticed.

---

## Hour 19

```limn
roo | new con | eld man par ben | liv her 40 yea | kno all | bui was fac
```

> *Rook. New contact. Elderly man, park bench. Lived here 40 years. Knows all. Building was factory.*

The old man knows the building's history. Knows when it changed hands. Knows the rumors. He talks and talks.

```limn
roo | old man say | new own 2 yea | bad fee | peo go in nu com out | afr
```

> *Rook. Old man says. New owners 2 years. Bad feeling. People go in, never come out. Afraid.*

You type a warning:

```limn
roo | eno | too man que | pul bac | ris exp
```

> *Rook. Enough. Too many questions. Pull back. Risk of exposure.*

But the message arrives too late.

---

## Hour 19:30

```limn
roo | urj | har sto own | see her on pho | loo at me | tal abo me
```

> *Rook. Urgent. Hardware store owner. See her on phone. Looking at me. Talking about me.*

The hardware store owner. The one who talked so freely. She wasn't friendly. She was connected. Everyone in this neighborhood knows who runs that building, and some of them report to the people inside.

```limn
roo ext now | lea are | nu ret | bur | go
```

> *Rook extract now. Leave area. Don't return. Burned. Go.*

---

## Hour 19:40

```limn
roo | mov | try lea | two men fol | fro bui | the kno | the fol
```

> *Rook. Moving. Trying to leave. Two men following. From building. They know. They're following.*

Rook moves faster. The men move faster.

```limn
roo | run | the run | str nar | tra hea | mor ahe | tra
```

> *Rook. Running. They're running. Streets narrow. Traffic heavy. More ahead. Trapped.*

---

## Hour 19:50

```limn
roo | cor | men bot sid | bui sec | the kno fac | the kno que | bur
```

> *Rook. Cornered. Men both sides. Building security. They know face. They know questions. Burned.*

Then, the last message:

```limn
roo | tak | dev des | sor | que too man | my fau | car sti hel | mis fai
```

> *Rook. Taken. Device destroyed. Sorry. Questions too many. My fault. Cardinal still held. Mission failed.*

The channel goes dead. Rook destroyed the device before capture. Professional to the end. But captured all the same.

---

## Hour 20

Silence on the channel. You stare at your screen.

The coffee shop owner was fine. The security guard was fine. But the hardware store, the vendor, the old man in the park--each question was a thread, and someone pulled them together. A stranger asking about the building. Shop after shop. Too many questions in too small a neighborhood.

```limn
roo sig los | dev des | cap pro | bui sec inc | car sec inc | mis com
```

> *Rook signal lost. Device destroyed. Capture probable. Building security increased. Cardinal security increased. Mission compromised.*

---

## Hour 24

You brief the network:

```limn
roo cap | loc pro kno | bui ale | sec dou | car unr | app fai | sta zer
```

> *Rook captured. Local probe known. Building alerted. Security doubled. Cardinal unreachable. Approach failed. Starting from zero.*

Worse than zero. They know someone is looking. They'll move Cardinal. They'll increase security. They'll watch the neighborhood. Every advantage Rook earned through questions, the enemy now knows you have.

The information was gold. But the cost of getting it was everything.

---

## FAILURE: ASKING AROUND

**Rook:** Captured. Asked too many questions to too many people. Someone reported to the building.
**Cardinal:** Still held. Security doubled. Will likely be moved.
**You:** Pushed for more intelligence when you had enough. Every additional question was an additional risk. The last ones broke the mission.

The locals knew things. They told Rook willingly. But not all locals are friendly, and not all friendly locals are safe. In a neighborhood controlled by the enemy, every conversation is a potential report. Every question is a signal.

Rook asked. Locals answered. And one of them answered to the building too.

---

```limn
que dan | one que saf | two que ris | thr que dan | ten que dea
```

*Questions dangerous. One question safe. Two questions risky. Three questions dangerous. Ten questions death.*

---

```limn
loc tal | loc hel | loc rep | sam loc | dif dir | you nev kno whi
```

*Locals talk. Locals help. Locals report. Same locals. Different directions. You never know which.*

```limn
fri fac dan | smi dan | ope dan | who tal fre | who tal ene | som bot
```

*Friendly face dangerous. Smile dangerous. Openness dangerous. Who talks freely? Who talks to enemy? Some both.*

```limn
eno was eno | mor was too | gre kil | inf had | pus wan | wan cos
```

*Enough was enough. More was too much. Greed kills. Information had. Pushed for want. Want cost.*

```limn
roo ski gre | que ski gre | ans cam fre | fre cos mos
```

*Rook skill great. Question skill great. Answers came free. Free costs most.*
