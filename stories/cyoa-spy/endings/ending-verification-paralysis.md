# ENDING: Paralysis

One more check. Then another. Cardinal's time ran out.

```limn
che | che | che | tim out | car bro | too lat
```

> Check. Check. Check. Time out. Cardinal broke. Too late.

## FAILURE: PARALYSIS

**Cardinal:** Broke under interrogation while you verified.
**Network:** Compromised by Cardinal's confession.

```limn
ver par | act nec | wai kil
```

*Verification paralysis. Action necessary. Waiting kills.*

**THE END**
