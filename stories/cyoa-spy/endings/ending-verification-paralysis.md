# ENDING: Paralysis

You sent:

```limn
wai | one mor che | bis ver int | roo ver pos | the go
```

> *Wait. One more check. Bishop verify intel. Rook verify position. Then go.*

One more check. Just to be sure. Cardinal can hold a little longer.

---

## Hour 18

Rook is in position. Bishop is watching. The plan is verified. But you hesitate.

```limn
bis | ver gua num | rep | how man lev 2 now
```

> *Bishop. Verify guard numbers. Report. How many level 2 now?*

```limn
bis | gua 4 lev 2 | sam bef | con | we go te
```

> *Bishop. Four guards level 2. Same as before. Confirmed. Do we go?*

Not yet. One more thing.

```limn
roo | ver ext rou | beh cle sti te
```

> *Rook. Verify extraction route. Rear still clear?*

---

## Hour 18:30

```limn
roo | beh cle | sam | con | han we go te
```

> *Rook. Rear clear. Same. Confirmed. Handler, do we go?*

Almost. You want to check the shift pattern one more time. The window is 30 minutes. You've used 30 already.

```limn
bis | nex shi whe | tim con
```

> *Bishop. Next shift when? Time confirm.*

```limn
bis | nex shi 2 hou | win sti ope | te urj | mov now te wai mor
```

> *Bishop. Next shift two hours. Window still open. But urgent. Move now or wait more?*

Two hours. Plenty of time. You can verify the interior layout one more time.

---

## Hour 19

```limn
bis | ver int lay | roo 3 sti car loc te
```

> *Bishop. Verify interior layout. Room 3 still Cardinal location?*

```limn
bis | can nu ver int | vis fro onl | roo 3 las kno | han pls | we che 3 tim | go
```

> *Bishop. Cannot verify interior. Visual from front only. Room 3 last known. Handler please. We've checked three times. Go.*

You hear the frustration. But what if the interior changed? What if they moved Cardinal?

```limn
roo | rep | any mov ins vis
```

> *Rook. Report. Any movement inside visible?*

```limn
roo | neg | qui | no mov 2 hou | han | car wai | we wai | why
```

> *Rook. Negative. Quiet. No movement two hours. Handler. Cardinal waits. We wait. Why?*

---

## Hour 20

You decide to check one more variable. The external perimeter.

```limn
roo | sca per | ene pat out bui | rep
```

> *Rook. Scan perimeter. Enemy patrol outside building. Report.*

```limn
roo | per sam | pat sam | all sam | not cha | han | go now | urj
```

> *Rook. Perimeter same. Patrol same. All same. Nothing changed. Handler. Go now. Urgent.*

You almost give the order. Then you think: what if there's a secondary exit they haven't mapped? What if the basement route is blocked?

```limn
bis | bas rou | con sti ope te
```

> *Bishop. Basement route. Confirm still open?*

```limn
bis | can nu see bas fro her | was ope | pro sti ope | han we los tim | car los tim
```

> *Bishop. Cannot see basement from here. Was open. Probably still open. Handler we're losing time. Cardinal losing time.*

---

## Hour 21

A new message. Not from your team.

```limn
arc | tha wai | car mov | loc new | you los
```

> *Architect. Thanks for waiting. Cardinal moved. Location new. You lost.*

Your stomach drops. You verify with Bishop:

```limn
bis | urj | car sti roo 3 te | vis
```

> *Bishop. Urgent. Cardinal still room 3? Visual.*

```limn
bis | mov | lig dif | veh beh | ene mov | the mov car | the mov car whi you che
```

> *Bishop. Movement. Lights different. Vehicle rear. Enemy moving. They moved Cardinal. They moved Cardinal while you checked.*

---

## Hour 21:30

```limn
roo | veh gon | car gon | we los the | new loc unk | sta ove
```

> *Rook. Vehicle gone. Cardinal gone. We lost them. New location unknown. Start over.*

You can't start over. The enemy knows you're watching. They moved Cardinal because your verification took too long. Your caution became a signal.

```limn
bis | dis | fai | han fai | too lon | too car | car gon bec car
```

> *Bishop. Disgusted. Failed. Handler failed. Too long. Too careful. Cardinal gone because of caution.*

---

## Hour 22

Final messages. Bitter and brief.

```limn
roo | ret | mis fai | sor
```

> *Rook. Returning. Mission failed. Sorry.*

```limn
bis | ret | nu sor | han cho thi | car pay pri
```

> *Bishop. Returning. Not sorry. Handler chose this. Cardinal pays price.*

Bishop is right. You had the window. You had the plan. You had the team. You verified everything three times and then verified again while they drove Cardinal away.

---

## FAILURE: PARALYSIS

**Cardinal:** Moved to unknown location. Lost.
**Bishop:** Returned. Furious. Trust in handler broken.
**Rook:** Returned. Silent.
**You:** Checked everything. Missed the only thing that mattered: time.

The plan was perfect. The verification was complete. The window was open. You just never walked through it.

---

```limn
ver goo | ver nec | ver kil | whe ver bec fea | fea win
```

*Verification good. Verification necessary. Verification kills. When verification becomes fear. Fear wins.*

---

```limn
win ope | win clo | you wat win | you che win | win gon
```

*Window opened. Window closed. You watched window. You checked window. Window gone.*

```limn
bis ask go | roo ask go | car nee go | you say wai | wai kil
```

*Bishop asked go. Rook asked go. Cardinal needed go. You said wait. Waiting killed.*

```limn
per pla | per ver | per tim | no per act | act onl thi mat
```

*Perfect plan. Perfect verification. Perfect timing. No perfect action. Action only thing that mattered.*

```limn
ene nu nee fig you | ene jus nee wai you | you wai you | you bea you
```

*Enemy didn't need to fight you. Enemy just needed to wait for you. You waited for you. You beat yourself.*

**THE END**
