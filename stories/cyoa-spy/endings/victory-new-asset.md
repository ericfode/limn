# ENDING: Fresh Face Wins

You sent:

```limn
kni | gui ext | bis act | rad coo | mov now
```

> *Knight guides extraction. Bishop acts. Radio coordination. Move now.*

Knight watches. Bishop moves. You coordinate. Everyone plays their part.

---

## Hour 21

Knight is still in the coffee shop. Untouched. Unknown. The enemy has never seen this face.

```limn
kni | pos ste | shi cha 15m | gua mov beh | fro cle 3m
```

> Knight. Position steady. Shift change fifteen minutes. Guards moving behind. Front clear three minutes.

Knight's observations are precise. No jargon, no bravado. Just what they see. Sometimes that's worth more than a decade of fieldwork.

---

## Hour 21:15

You relay to Bishop:

```limn
we bis | kni rep shi cha now | beh dor one gua | win 3m | mov
```

> *Imperative: Bishop. Knight reports shift change now. Rear door one guard. Window three minutes. Move.*

Bishop moves on Knight's timing.

```limn
bis | mov | beh dor | gua dow | ins
```

> Bishop. Moving. Rear door. Guard down. Inside.

---

## Hour 21:20

Knight keeps watching. The coffee is cold. Hands are steady.

```limn
kni | fro sti cle | nu new gua | bis saf | con
```

> Knight. Front still clear. No new guards. Bishop safe. Confirmed.

You breathe. Knight can't see inside the building, but they can see everything outside it. And right now, outside is what matters.

---

## Hour 21:25

```limn
bis | lev 2 | roo 3 | car fou | ali | wea | ext now
```

> Bishop. Level 2. Room 3. Cardinal found. Alive. Weak. Extracting now.

You relay immediately:

```limn
we kni | bis ext car | sta cle | rep cha out
```

> *Imperative: Knight. Bishop extracting Cardinal. Stay clear. Report any changes outside.*

---

## Hour 21:30

Knight spots it first:

```limn
kni | urj | veh bla app | two | ene rei te | bis out now | now now
```

> Knight. Urgent. Vehicle black approaching. Two. Enemy reinforcements? Bishop out now. Now now.

The panic in the double "now" is real. But the warning is early. Thirty seconds of lead time -- an eternity in extraction.

You relay:

```limn
we bis | ene app fro | ext beh | run | kni eye sav you
```

> *Imperative: Bishop. Enemy approaching front. Exit rear. Run. Knight's eyes saved you.*

---

## Hour 21:32

Bishop emerges from the rear with Cardinal. They cross the alley. They reach the car.

```limn
bis | car saf | ext suc | veh gon | cle
```

> Bishop. Cardinal safe. Extraction successful. Vehicle gone. Clear.

Knight watches the black cars pull up to the front entrance. Guards pour out. Five minutes later and everyone would be dead.

---

## Hour 22

Knight leaves the coffee shop. Pays the bill. Walks away like any other customer.

No one looks twice.

```limn
kni | dep | cle | nu fol | saf | fre eye win
```

> Knight. Departing. Clear. No followers. Safe. Fresh eyes win.

---

## VICTORY: FRESH FACE WINS

**Cardinal:** Rescued. Alive. Recovering.
**Bishop:** Successful extraction. Relied on Knight's eyes.
**Knight:** Never seen. Never suspected. Still unknown.
**Network:** Intact. Stronger. Has a new asset.
**You:** Used the right tool for the job. A watcher who could watch.

The enemy will study their cameras. They'll look for agents -- trained operators, known faces, suspicious patterns. They'll never think to look for the person drinking cold coffee across the street.

---

```limn
bes age | age ene nev see | bes eye | eye ene nev kno | kni bot
```

*Best agent: agent enemy never sees. Best eyes: eyes enemy never knows. Knight was both.*

---

```limn
net hav roo | net hav bis | net nee kni | fre fac | unk fac | win fac
```

*Network had Rook. Network had Bishop. Network needed Knight. Fresh face. Unknown face. Winning face.*

```limn
you sen kni wat | kni wat | kni see | kni sav | sim ord | sim vic
```

*You sent Knight to watch. Knight watched. Knight saw. Knight saved. Simple order. Simple victory.*

```limn
old age kno too muc | ene kno old age | kni kno not | not kno pow
```

*Old agents know too much. Enemy knows old agents. Knight known to none. Not known is power.*

```limn
cof col | han ste | eye sha | car fre | som vic tas lik col cof
```

*Coffee cold. Hands steady. Eyes sharp. Cardinal freed. Some victories taste like cold coffee.*
