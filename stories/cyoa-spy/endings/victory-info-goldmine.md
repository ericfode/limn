# ENDING: Local Heroes

You sent:

```limn
roo acc loc hel | dis pla | civ coo | bui ent dur | ext car | go
```

> *Rook: accept local help. Distraction plan. Civilian cooperation. Building entry during. Extract Cardinal. Go.*

The locals want to help. You let them.

---

## Hour 17

Rook meets with the coffee shop owner again. This time, not as a journalist. As an ally.

```limn
roo | cof own | nam mar | hat bui | hat peo ins | wan hel | rea
```

> *Rook. Coffee shop owner. Name: Maria. Hates building. Hates people inside. Wants to help. Real.*

You assess:

```limn
roo | ver int | she gen te | tru lev | hig | pro
```

> *Rook. Verify intent. She genuine? Trust level? High? Proceed.*

```limn
roo | gen | she los cus | nei afr | bui kil com | she wan it gon
```

> *Rook. Genuine. She lost customers. Neighborhood afraid. Building kills community. She wants it gone.*

Not political. Not ideological. A woman whose neighborhood was stolen by bad people in a concrete building. She wants her street back.

---

## Hour 18

Maria brings others. The security guard Rook talked to earlier. The street vendor. An elderly man from the park.

```limn
roo | gro for | 5 loc | all kno bui | all wan hel | pla mak
```

> *Rook. Group formed. Five locals. All know building. All want to help. Plan making.*

You send guidance:

```limn
roo | loc dis onl | nu dan for the | noi lig att | we do res | cle
```

> *Rook. Locals distract only. No danger for them. Noise, lights, attention. We do the rest. Clear?*

```limn
roo | con | the und | the wan hel not fig | dis onl | agr
```

> *Rook. Confirmed. They understand. They want to help, not fight. Distraction only. Agreed.*

---

## Hour 20

The plan comes together. Maria will call in a gas leak to the fire department. The street vendor will block the back road with his cart. The security guard knows which entrance the guards use for smoke breaks. The old man will watch and signal.

```limn
roo | pla set | mar cal fir dep | ven blo bac | gua ent kno | old man eye | red
```

> *Rook. Plan set. Maria calls fire department. Vendor blocks back. Guard entrance known. Old man watches. Ready.*

```limn
con | tim 22:00 | dis fir | roo ent dur con | ext bef fir arr | tig
```

> *Confirmed. Time: 22:00. Distraction first. Rook enters during confusion. Extract before fire arrives. Tight.*

---

## Hour 22

Maria makes the call. Gas leak at the industrial building. She sounds terrified. She's convincing because part of her isn't acting.

```limn
roo | cal mad | sir soo | bui gua con | fro gua mov che | bac cle
```

> *Rook. Call made. Sirens soon. Building guards confused. Front guards moved to check. Back clear.*

The vendor's cart blocks the alley. Anyone trying to leave the back way has to go around. The old man sits on his bench, watching, counting guards.

```limn
roo | bac ent | gua gon fro | ins | mov fas
```

> *Rook. Back entrance. Guards gone to front. Inside. Moving fast.*

---

## Hour 22:05

Sirens in the distance. The fire department is coming. The guards are arguing at the front gate--there's no gas leak, but they have to let the firefighters check. Procedure. Bureaucracy. The distraction of civic order.

```limn
roo | ins lev 2 | gua dis fro | sir lou | con | sea for car
```

> *Rook. Inside level 2. Guards distracted at front. Sirens loud. Confusion. Searching for Cardinal.*

```limn
roo | dor loc | pic | ope | car ins | ali | fou
```

> *Rook. Door locked. Picked. Open. Cardinal inside. Alive. Found.*

---

## Hour 22:10

```limn
car | wh hap | sir | fir te
```

> *Cardinal. What's happening? Sirens? Fire?*

```limn
roo | dis | fri hel | com now | ext bac | fas
```

> *Rook. Distraction. Friends helped. Come now. Extract back way. Fast.*

Rook and Cardinal move through level 2. The guards are at the front, dealing with firefighters who insist on inspecting the building. The back halls are empty.

```limn
roo | bac sta | dow | lev 1 | bac dor | ven car blo all | cle pat aro
```

> *Rook. Back stairs. Down. Level 1. Back door. Vendor cart blocks alley. Clear path around.*

---

## Hour 22:15

Rook and Cardinal emerge from the back. The old man on his bench gives a small nod. The path is clear. Rook's vehicle is two blocks away.

```limn
roo | out | car out | old man nod | cle | mov to veh | ext
```

> *Rook. Outside. Cardinal outside. Old man nods. Clear. Moving to vehicle. Extracting.*

Maria watches from her coffee shop window. The firefighters are still arguing with the guards. The vendor is apologizing for his broken cart blocking the alley. The old man is just an old man on a bench.

Nobody is a hero. Everyone is a hero.

---

## Hour 23

```limn
roo | veh mov | car saf | lea are | dis end soo | fir lea | gua nev kno
```

> *Rook. Vehicle moving. Cardinal safe. Leaving area. Distraction ending soon. Fire leaving. Guards never knew.*

Cardinal, weak but free:

```limn
car | who hel | who peo | loc te | civ te | the ris for me
```

> *Cardinal. Who helped? Who are these people? Locals? Civilians? They risked for me?*

```limn
roo | nei | the ris for the | bui too the com | you jus ins it
```

> *Rook. No. They risked for themselves. Building took their community. You were just inside it.*

---

## VICTORY: LOCAL HEROES

**Cardinal:** Rescued. Carried out by the same community the building had terrorized.
**Rook:** Listened to locals. Built trust. Let them help in their own way.
**Maria:** Made a phone call. Got her neighborhood back.
**You:** Let civilians into the operation. Broke protocol. Won because of it.

The building held Cardinal for months. But it also held a neighborhood hostage--shops losing business, people afraid to walk their streets, an old man watching from his bench as bad things happened behind concrete walls.

You didn't bring an army. You brought a community. A coffee shop owner, a vendor, a guard, an old man. They didn't fight. They just did what civilians do: called the fire department, blocked a road, sat on a bench. And inside that ordinary noise, Rook pulled Cardinal out.

---

```limn
com str | civ str | peo str | whe pro fig | com hel | com win
```

*Community strength. Civilian strength. People strength. When professionals fight, community helps. Community wins.*

---

```limn
mar cal pho | ven par car | old man sat | ord act | ext res
```

*Maria called phone. Vendor parked cart. Old man sat. Ordinary actions. Extraordinary results.*

```limn
loc hat bui | loc hat fea | loc hat sil | you gav the voi | the use it
```

*Locals hated building. Locals hated fear. Locals hated silence. You gave them voice. They used it.*

```limn
spy thi alo | spy wor alo | spy wro | peo hel | peo alw hel | ask
```

*Spies think alone. Spies work alone. Spies wrong. People help. People always help. Ask.*

```limn
bui fal | not bom | not gun | pho cal | fir tru | bro car | old man nod
```

*Building fell. Not bombs. Not guns. Phone call. Fire truck. Broken cart. Old man's nod.*
