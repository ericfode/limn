## Summary: The Grammar of Wisdom

Limn proverbs share structural patterns:

| Pattern | Meaning | Examples |
|---------|---------|----------|
| `A B \| B A` | Reversal-symmetry | `flo res \| res flo` |
| `A nu A` | Self-negation | `kno nu kno` |
| `A B bet` | Liminal space | `alo tog bet` |
| `A B \| sam` | Unity of opposites | `hot col \| sam` |
| `A B ins` | Containment | `pas fut now ins` |

These patterns are not mere rhetoric but encode Limn's core insight: meaning exists in superposition until collapsed by context. A proverb that works in multiple keys simultaneously is not vague—it is *dense*.

## On Using Limn Proverbs

Unlike English aphorisms, Limn proverbs do not collapse to a single meaning when spoken. The speaker offers a semantic region; the listener navigates it with their own key.

This makes Limn proverbs particularly suited to:
- **Counseling:** The same phrase meets different people differently
- **Teaching:** Students find their own relevant meaning
- **Art:** Ambiguity is preserved, not resolved
- **Ritual:** Communal speaking creates communal superposition

A Limn proverb is not "said at" someone but "opened between" people.
