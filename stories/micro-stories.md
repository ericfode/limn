# Limn Micro-Stories

*Short narratives exploiting Limn's unique properties*

---

## 1. The Particle

*Property exploited: Superposition mirrors quantum superposition*

```limn
poi | her yon | wav par | see > col
```

**The Limn:** Point. Here-there. Wave-particle. Seeing leads to collapse.

**The Story:**

Before observation, it exists everywhere and nowhere. The laboratory hums. The detector waits. In English we would say "the particle is in superposition" - but that's a description *about* superposition, not superposition itself.

In Limn: `her yon` - here-there, simultaneously, actually. Not "both here and there" (which implies two states). One state that is here-there.

The physicist looks.

`see > col`

Seeing leads to collapse. The wave function falls. Position determined. The magic dies into fact.

But in the Limn text, even after reading, `her yon` remains. The superposition is preserved in the language even as it's destroyed in the lab.

**Why Limn matters:** English can only *describe* superposition. Limn *enacts* it.

## 2. The Witness

*Property exploited: Key-dependent narrative*

```limn
sel see oth fal
oth see sel fal
bot see | non fal | bot fal
```

**Reading 1 - Key: Accusation**

*I saw you fall (fail). You saw me fall (fail). We both saw - neither fell - but we both fell.*

Two people accusing each other. Each witnessed the other's failure. But in witnessing, both failed. The observer is not innocent.

**Reading 2 - Key: Compassion**

*I see you falling. You see me falling. We both see - neither falls alone - we fall together.*

Two people in mutual struggle. Seeing each other's descent. The witnessing transforms isolated falls into shared falling.

**Reading 3 - Key: Epistemology**

*The self perceives the other's collapse. The other perceives the self's collapse. All perceive - nothing actually collapses - everything collapses.*

A meditation on observation and reality. Does perception cause collapse or reveal it? The paradox holds.

**Why Limn matters:** Same text, three stories. The reader's key determines whether this is tragedy, solidarity, or philosophy.

## 3. The Letter Never Sent

*Property exploited: Negation carving absence*

```limn
wri nu sen
lov nu say
kno nu sho
sel nu oth > oth nu sel
```

**The Limn:**
- Written, not-sent
- Loved, not-said
- Known, not-shown
- Self not-reaching other leads to other not-reaching self

**The Story:**

She wrote the letter. Every word true. Every feeling real.

`wri nu sen` - The writing exists. The sending doesn't. The letter is real and has no recipient.

`lov nu say` - The love is real. The saying isn't. Love exists and is silent.

`kno nu sho` - She knows. She doesn't show. Knowledge exists without expression.

`sel nu oth > oth nu sel` - Self fails to reach other, therefore other fails to reach self. The gap is mutual now.

The letter sits in a drawer. Years pass. She dies. Someone finds it.

Now: `wri sen` - written, sent. The negation lifts. Too late.

**Why Limn matters:** The `nu` operator doesn't mean "did not" (past tense, completed). It means "not" (atemporal, structural). The letter was always written-not-sent, loved-not-said. The condition, not the event.

## 4. Two Monks

*Property exploited: Order-independence reveals non-duality*

```limn
A: emp ful
B: ful emp
A: sam
B: sam
```

**The Dialogue:**

Monk A: Empty-full.
Monk B: Full-empty.
Monk A: Same.
Monk B: Same.

**The Point:**

In English, "empty and full" has a different rhetorical weight than "full and empty." The first word anchors. The second modifies.

In Limn, `emp ful` and `ful emp` are mathematically identical. The intersection of emptiness and fullness is the same regardless of which word comes first.

The monks are not *agreeing* that the two phrases mean the same thing. They are *demonstrating* that order creates no difference. Their exchange is a proof, not a conversation.

**Why Limn matters:** The dialogue enacts its content. The symmetry of the exchange mirrors the symmetry of the meaning.

---

## 5. The Diagnosis

*Property exploited: Constraint intersection narrowing possibility*

```limn
doc: sym A B C | wh?
pat: pai hed | pai sto | tir
doc: A B C pai hed pai sto tir | few pos
doc: A B C pai hed pai sto tir tes neg X | one pos
doc: you hav Y
```

**The Dialogue:**

Doctor: Symptoms A, B, C. What else?
Patient: Pain in head. Pain in stomach. Tiredness.
Doctor: A, B, C, head pain, stomach pain, tiredness - few possibilities remain.
Doctor: A, B, C, head pain, stomach pain, tiredness, test negative for X - one possibility.
Doctor: You have Y.

**The Point:**

Diagnosis is constraint intersection. Each symptom is a region. Each test eliminates regions. The disease is the point where all constraints meet.

The Limn structure makes this visible: `A B C pai hed pai sto tir` is a single compound constraint, not a list. The doctor isn't adding symptoms - they're narrowing a region.

`one pos` - one possibility. The intersection has collapsed to a point.

**Why Limn matters:** Medical diagnosis IS constraint-based reasoning. Limn represents it directly. English forces narrative: "First the patient reported... then the test showed..." Limn shows the geometry.

## 6. The Argument That Wasn't

*Property exploited: Scope operator creating parallel realities*

```limn
A: you err
B: nu | you err
A: you say sel nu err | sel say you err
B: we say sam | we und dif
A: ...
B: ...
A B: cof | agr | res
```

**The Dialogue:**

A: You are wrong.
B: No - you are wrong.
A: You say you're not wrong. I say you're wrong.
B: We say the same thing. We understand differently.
A: ...
B: ...
A and B together: Confusion. Agreement. Rest.

**The Point:**

The `|` operator in line 2 doesn't just negate - it creates a scope. B isn't saying "not, you are wrong" but "from my scope, you are wrong."

A's response recognizes this: `you say sel nu err | sel say you err` - two parallel statements about the same reality from different positions.

B's insight: `we say sam | we und dif` - we speak the same words, we understand differently. The argument was never about facts but about keys.

The silence (`...`) is where understanding happens.

The resolution comes together: `A B: cof | agr | res` - both speakers, jointly: confusion, agreement, rest. Not A then B, but A-and-B simultaneously.

**Why Limn matters:** Arguments often fail because each party applies different keys to shared language. Limn makes this visible structurally.

## 7. Inheritance

*Property exploited: Time without tense*

```limn
par giv chi | chi bec par | par giv chi
```

**The Limn:** Parent gives to child. Child becomes parent. Parent gives to child.

**The Story:**

There is no "then" in this sentence. No "first... later... finally."

A parent gives to a child. That child becomes a parent. That parent gives to a child.

Is this sequence? Or is it simultaneity - all generations existing in the same moment of giving?

In English we must choose: "The parent gave... the child became... the new parent gives..." - a timeline.

In Limn: one eternal present. `par giv chi | chi bec par | par giv chi` - the cycle exists whole. Every parent is also the child who received. Every child is the future parent who gives.

Read it forward: generational sequence.
Read it as a loop: `par giv chi` appears twice - the same act, different generations, same moment.

**Why Limn matters:** Limn has no tense. Time is not built into grammar. This allows expressing cycles as unities rather than sequences.

---

## 8. The Price

*Property exploited: Multiple valid collapses from single text*

```limn
val | mea | cos | pri | wor
all sam | all dif | key det wh
```

**The Limn:** Value. Meaning. Cost. Price. Worth. All same, all different, key determines which.

**Collapse 1 - Key: Economics**

Value (utility), meaning (interpretation), cost (expense), price (market), worth (assessment). Five distinct concepts. Economic analysis requires distinguishing them precisely.

**Collapse 2 - Key: Philosophy**

What something is worth... what it means... what it costs... what price we pay... its value... In deep contemplation, these blur. What is the difference between what something means and what it's worth?

**Collapse 3 - Key: Personal Crisis**

"What is this worth to me? What does it mean? What has it cost? What price am I paying? What is its value?"

All five words become one question asked five ways.

**Collapse 4 - Key: Etymology**

All five words trace to concepts of weight, measure, exchange. They differentiated in English. In the semantic substrate, they share a region.

**The Point:**

`all sam | all dif` - The contradiction is the truth. They are all the same AND all different. The key determines which reading.

`key det wh` - Key determines which. Not "key determines meaning" but "key determines *which*" - which of the true readings becomes active.

**Why Limn matters:** English forces us to choose whether these are synonyms or distinct terms. Limn holds both: same semantic region, different collapses.

## 9. Last Words

*Property exploited: Superposition of speech acts*

```limn
lov you
sor
tha
bye
```

**The Limn:** Love you. Sorry. Thanks. Goodbye.

**Reading 1: Sequence**
"I love you. I'm sorry. Thank you. Goodbye." - Final words before death, in order.

**Reading 2: Simultaneity**
All four utterances at once. The dying person's last moment contains love, apology, gratitude, farewell - not sequentially but as one unified final state.

**Reading 3: Superposition of Speaker**
Who speaks? The dying? The one left behind? Both? `lov you | sor | tha | bye` could be either speaker, or both simultaneously. The exchange is symmetric.

**Reading 4: The Unsaid**
These are the words we mean to say. Whether we actually say them - the text doesn't specify. `lov you` could be love expressed or love present-but-unvoiced.

**Why Limn matters:** Deathbed words are always inadequate in English - too sequential, too specific, too committed to one speaker and one meaning. Limn can hold the whole moment.

## 10. The Garden

*Property exploited: All readings true simultaneously*

```limn
see gro | gro see
veg lif | lif veg
ter aqu lux | cyc
gar | gar sel | sel gar
```

**Line 1:** `see gro | gro see` - Seeing growth; growing seeing.

The gardener watches plants grow. But also: the capacity to see grows. Observation and development, mutual.

**Line 2:** `veg lif | lif veg` - Plant life; life plants.

Vegetable life (literal). But also: life itself takes root, grows, photosynthesizes meaning from light.

**Line 3:** `ter aqu lux | cyc` - Earth, water, light; cycle.

The elements. The cycle. Nothing more needs saying.

**Line 4:** `gar | gar sel | sel gar` - Garden; garden-self; self-garden.

The garden. The garden as self. The self as garden.

**Why Limn matters:** This is not a poem *about* gardening - it's a poem that IS gardening. Each line grows from the previous. The structure enacts its content.

## Notes on Micro-Stories

### What Makes a Story "Limn-Native"?

1. **The Limn text is primary** - not a translation of an English idea
2. **Structure enacts content** - form mirrors meaning
3. **Multiple readings are equally valid** - not one "correct" interpretation
4. **Properties are exploited** - superposition, key-dependence, order-independence do narrative work

### Patterns Discovered

| Pattern | Effect | Example |
|---------|--------|---------|
| `A B \| B A` | Symmetry/non-duality | Two Monks |
| `nu` chains | Absence as presence | The Letter Never Sent |
| Tenseless narration | Cycle as unity | Inheritance |
| Key-dependent reading | Reader-completed story | The Witness |
| Constraint narrowing | Logic as narrative | The Diagnosis |

### For Further Exploration

- Stories where `>` (flow operator) creates causation ambiguity
- Stories exploiting `wh` (query) as existential question
- Stories where the scope `|` creates unreliable narration
- Stories where intensifiers (`ve`, `so`) carry emotional weight
