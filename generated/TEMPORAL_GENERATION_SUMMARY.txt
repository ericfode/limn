USAGE RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

For Duration Understanding:
  Use gradient expressions (lon^0.1 to lon^0.9) to map duration onto
  intensity scale. Combine with fusion for contrasts: (lon^0.9)*bre^0.1

For Temporal States:
  Use fusion expressions (pas*fut, bir*dea) for liminal/threshold moments.
  Combine with polarity (pas ± fut) for ambiguous states.

For Process Description:
  Use intensity-mapped change words (gro^0.8, dec^0.5) to specify process rate.
  Combine with binding (@) for sequential processes.

For Temporal Relationships:
  Use binding expressions (pas@now@fut) for continuous chains.
  Use conditional (given) for dependent relationships.
  Use without for exclusions and contrasts.

For Complete Spectra:
  Use polarity networks: alw ± oft ± onc ± rar ± nev (frequency spectrum)
  Use gradient binding: (lon^0.1)@(lon^0.9) (duration spectrum)
