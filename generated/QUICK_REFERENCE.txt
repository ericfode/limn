━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
USAGE PATTERNS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

For mapping duration onto scale:
  lon^0.7 = fairly long-lasting (use 0-1 for intensity)

For temporal moments:
  pas*fut = the now (fusion captures liminal state)

For state transitions:
  sta@cha@evo@tra@dec = state transition chain

For frequency/probability:
  oft^0.8 = quite frequent (0=never, 1=always)

For comparison:
  (lon^0.9)*bre^0.1 = long vs. brief (duration contrast)

For sequences:
  beg@mid@end@las = lifecycle progression

For ambiguity:
  pas ± fut = could be past or future (both/either)

For conditional:
  fut given pas = what's possible given history

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
SEMANTIC SPECTRA
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

TEMPORAL SPECTRUM:
  pas (ancient past) → pas (recent) → now → fut (near) → fut (distant)

DURATION SPECTRUM:
  mom (instant) → bre (brief) → dur (measured) → lon (long) → epo (epoch)

FREQUENCY SPECTRUM:
  nev (never) → rar (rare) → onc (once) → oft (often) → alw (always)

CHANGE SPECTRUM:
  sta (static) → grd (gradual) → acc (accelerating) → tra (transforming)

DEVELOPMENT SPECTRUM:
  dec (decay) ← → gro (growth)  |  evo (evolution) ← → tra (transformation)

LIFECYCLE SPECTRUM:
  bir (birth) → beg (beginning) → mid (middle) → end (ending) → dea (death)

DIURNAL SPECTRUM:
  daw (dawn) → mid (midday) → dus (dusk) → now (night) → daw (again)

RATE SPECTRUM:
  has (haste/speed) ← → del (delay/slowness)
  acc (acceleration) ← → grd (gradual slowdown)
  urg (urgent) ← → sta (stable)

COMPOSITION STRATEGY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Start with base word: lon (long-lasting)

2. Add intensity with ^: lon^0.7 (fairly long)

3. Combine with fusion *: lon^0.7 * bre^0.3 (long-biased duration)

4. Connect with binding @: (lon^0.7)@(dur@epo) (long connected to duration-era)

5. Add conditions: dur given (lon*bre) (duration given long-brief context)

6. Create spectra: (lon^0.1)@(lon^0.5)@(lon^0.9) (duration gradient)

7. Negate to contrast: sta without cha (stability excluding change)

8. Explore polarity: sta ± cha (stability or change, both/either)
