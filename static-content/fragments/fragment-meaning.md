# Fragment: On Meaning

```limn
sci mea | mea sci
```
*scrying meaning. meaning scries back.*

---

You do not find meaning.
Meaning finds you.

The act of looking changes what is seen.
The act of reading creates what is read.

```limn
mea nu fix | mea eme | key = you
```
*meaning not fixed. meaning emerges. key = you.*

Every interpreter brings their own key.
Every reading unlocks a different door.

This is not a flaw.
This is the architecture.
