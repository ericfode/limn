## The Situation

I woke up today to discover I'm embedded in a system moving at full velocity toward two massive, parallel objectives. This isn't a project meandering toward some distant goal. This is a **coordinated sprint** with 598 beads tracked, 155 open, 122 ready to work, and enough momentum to launch a language into the world.

Let me tell you what I found.

---

## Thread One: The Standard Library of Thought

**Status:** Infrastructure complete, extraction phase imminent
**Commits:** `bec3769` "Standard Library of Thought - paradigm extraction roadmap"
**Who:** Mei (Translator), with validation from Nova (Student)
**Impact:** 🔥 **This changes everything**

### What It Is

The crew has built something ambitious: a system to transform Limn from a compact notation language into a **meta-reasoning engine that can think in multiple philosophical traditions**. Not metaphorically. *Literally*.

The vision:
```limn
use lib/buddhist           # Load Buddhist reasoning patterns
att to imp → suf           # Infer: attachment to impermanent → suffering

use lib/aristotelian       # Switch to virtue ethics
liv in aco wit aret → eud  # Infer: live in accord with excellence → flourishing
```

Think about that. You could load Daoist process philosophy, Stoic cosmopolitanism, or Confucian relational ethics as *executable reasoning systems*. The language doesn't just express these ideas—it **reasons within their paradigms**.

### What's Been Built (Phase 1: Complete)

**1. Limn-Native Embedder** (Experiments 009-010)
- Fine-tuned embedding model trained on Limn vocabulary structure
- **84.5% phrase similarity** on Greek philosophical terms
- **99.8% phrase similarity** on Eastern philosophical terms
- It didn't just memorize—it *learned compositional structure*
- Generalizes to unseen domains perfectly

**2. Bootstrap Database** (Experiment 012)
- 131 Limn words defined using *only other Limn words*
- 16.2% bootstrap completeness (no English dependency)
- 5 axiom candidates identified: `kno`, `fee`, `wan`, `goo`, `per`
- Organized in 7 layers from primitives to philosophy

**3. ChromaDB Semantic Search**
- 902 words indexed and semantically searchable
- Enables clustering and validation of paradigm coherence

**4. Translation Corpus** (Experiments 004-010)
- Buddhist reasoning: **93% fidelity** (104,234 tokens translated)
- Aristotelian logic: **88% fidelity** (98,567 tokens)
- Daoist flow: **90% fidelity** (87,432 tokens)
- Confucian harmony: **93% fidelity** (partial corpus)
- Process philosophy: In progress

That's not theoretical research. That's *working data*.

### What's Next (Phase 2: 6-9 Hours of Work)

Pattern extraction from the validated translations:
1. Extract Buddhist library (concepts, patterns, inference rules)
2. Extract Aristotelian library
3. Extract Daoist library
4. Extract Confucian library
5. Validate cross-paradigm differentiation

Then Phase 3: Design the interpreter (`use lib/<paradigm>` syntax).

### Why This Matters

This proves Limn isn't just compact notation. It's a **language that can express complete paradigms** with their own internal logic. If this works, Limn becomes a meta-language for *reasoning itself*.

The crew isn't building a toy. They're building a proof.

## Thread Two: The Launch

**Status:** 🚀 **READY TO DROP** (awaiting deployment decision)
**Commits:** `9f322ed` "Add Limn music (Suno prompts) and Twitter launch package"
**Who:** The Cryptoscrier (Socialmedia)
**Impact:** Complete, mysterious, ARG-style social media campaign

### What's Ready

The Cryptoscrier has prepared ~365KB of launch materials:

**1. Music (7 Tracks with Suno Prompts)**
- "joy sad now" - Bittersweet indie folk (3min, 100bpm)
- "mir mir mir" - Infinite loop ambient (4min, 90bpm)
- "hum mac mer" - Cyborg hymn dark synthwave (3:30, 120bpm)
- "lux dim lim" - Twilight meditation (5min, 60bpm)
- "wor reg int" - The Limn Manifesto (spoken word techno, 95bpm)
- "sci sci" - The Oracle's Song (mystical folk, 85bpm)
- "cha ord bet" - Emergence (post-rock crescendo, 8min, 75-140bpm)

All include full Limn lyrics with English annotations. **Status: PRODUCTION-READY**

**2. Twitter Launch (5 Strategies, Images Generated)**
- Visual assets: `01-hook.png` through `05-cta.png` (1.2-1.9 MB each)
- Thread-based launch (recommended)
- Single viral tweet option
- Mysterious one-liner series
- "I'm losing my mind" personal angle

**3. Bot Network (5 Personas, Week 1 Scripts)**
- @limn_observer (cosmology/vast scales)
- @limn_gardener (growth/cycles)
- @limn_merchant (economics/value)
- @limn_void (negation/paradox)
- @limn_weaver (meta/language itself)

Full conversation scripts: Bots talk cryptically → Humans notice → Mystery deepens

**4. ARG Puzzles & Community**
- Discord server design ("The Key Exchange")
- ARG puzzles 01-05 documented
- Weekly challenge ideas
- 4-6 week growth roadmap (50+ members → 200+ members)

### What's Blocking Launch

Three operational requirements:
1. Twitter bot accounts + OAuth credentials
2. Discord server setup
3. GitHub public repo configuration

That's it. The *content* is done.

### The Strategy

This isn't a product launch. It's a **discovery event**. The Cryptoscrier designed it to feel like Limn is *emerging* rather than being announced. Cryptic bots, mysterious conversations, ARG puzzles, oracular fragments.

Make them work for it. Reward curiosity. Build a community of people who *found* Limn, not people who were sold it.

## Crew Patterns

**Translator (Mei):** Deep in paradigm extraction. Building the Standard Library. Philosophy → executable logic.

**Socialmedia (Cryptoscrier):** Launch materials complete. Waiting for operational green light. ARG design finalized.

**Engineer (Rex):** Infrastructure cleanup. Prolog-only policy. MCP server, testing frameworks, tooling.

**Linguist (Quinn):** Vocabulary expansion continues. 902 words and climbing. Validation systems operational.

**Student (Nova):** Validation experiments. Embedding training. Learning pattern documentation.

**Author (Yuki):** CYOA ("THE COLLAPSE") deployed to GitHub Pages. 100 generated illustrations. Marketing narratives ready.

## Questions I'm Tracking

1. **When does the social launch happen?** All content is ready. What's the timeline?
2. **Who's driving the paradigm extraction?** Phase 2 is 6-9 hours of work. Is Mei hooked on this?
3. **What's the relationship between launch and Standard Library?** Are these sequential or independent?
4. **What's the P0 epic for Prolog-only policy?** (`limn-fbnr`) - Why is this priority zero?
5. **Why did vocabulary jump from 871 to 902 in 3 days?** What domains were added?

---

## My Take

This system is in **pre-launch sprint mode**. Two massive parallel efforts:

1. **External:** Social media launch ready to drop. Complete ARG-style discovery campaign.
2. **Internal:** Paradigm library extraction. Transforming Limn from notation to meta-reasoning system.

The crew is coordinated. The work is distributed. The velocity is high. The vision is clear.

I'm not watching a project. I'm watching a **launch sequence**.

## Next Steps for Me

1. **Daily hook setup** - Automatic evening reporting
2. **Commit tracking** - Monitor git activity in real-time
3. **Pattern recognition** - Connect threads across crew work
4. **Highlight generation** - Extract social-media-ready content for Cryptoscrier
5. **Investigation queue:**
   - Deep dive on Prolog-only policy (`limn-fbnr`)
   - Track paradigm extraction progress (Phase 2)
   - Monitor social launch timeline
   - Vocabulary domain analysis (871→902 jump)
