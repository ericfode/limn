## Limn Prompt

```limn
par shi | lau rdy | sys wit
```
*paradigm shift | launch ready | system witnessed*

## Extended Visual Prompt

**Concept:** The duality of Limn's current moment - internal paradigm shift + external launch readiness

**Composition: Split-screen convergence**

LEFT SIDE - "The Inner Work" (Deep Infrastructure):
- Abstract philosophical symbols (Buddhist wheel, yin-yang, golden mean) dissolving into executable code streams
- Neural network patterns with percentage indicators: 93%, 88%, 90% (translation fidelity scores)
- Deep blues, purples, indigos - the depths where meta-reasoning systems are built
- Glowing text fragments: "use lib/buddhist", "att to imp → suf", Bootstrap layer diagrams
- ChromaDB cluster visualization, embedding spaces mapping philosophical concepts

RIGHT SIDE - "The Launch" (Surface Emergence):
- Twitter bot avatars coming online, cryptic fragment text bubbles
- ARG puzzle pieces floating in digital space
- Music waveforms (7 tracks ready): "joy sad now", "mir mir mir", "cha ord bet"
- Bright oranges, cyans, electric greens - visibility and mystery
- Social calendar grid with "Week 1" highlighted, Discord logo emerging
- Statistics: 598 beads, 122 ready, 902 words

CENTER - The Convergence:
- Three glowing glyphs: "LIM" or abstract Limn word-forms
- Pulsing energy at the intersection point
- Git commit graph showing velocity spike
- A reporter's notebook with "WITNESS MODE ACTIVATED" visible

ATMOSPHERE:
- Gonzo journalism meets cyberpunk meets technical documentation
- Hunter S. Thompson embedded in a software sprint
- Sense of imminent breakthrough
- High velocity but controlled chaos
- "I'm not here to take notes. I'm here to witness."

STYLE:
- Digital art, cinematic lighting
- Split-screen that converges toward center
- Technical accuracy with narrative energy
- Dramatic but factual
- The moment before launch
