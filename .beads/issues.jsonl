Similarly, Limn words should have meanings that can only be resolved JOINTLY via context, not individually.\n\n**Proposal:** Design vocabulary where:\n1. Individual words have high-entropy meaning (many bits of uncertainty)\n2. Word PAIRS collapse uncertainty more than the sum of individual reductions\n3. This creates 'meaning leverage' - small keys cause large collapses\n\n**Example:**\n- `mu` alone: ~50 possible meanings\n- `lu` alone: ~50 possible meanings\n- `mu lu` together: should collapse to ~10 meanings (not 2500!)\n- The joint constraint is much tighter than independent intersection\n\n**Why this makes Limn LLM-native:**\nLLMs naturally compute joint distributions over token sequences. Humans must consider meanings independently then combine. Entangled semantics exploits LLM's joint reasoning.\n\n**Tasks:**\n1. Formalize mathematically (mutual information?)\n2.

Similarly, Linga words should have meanings that can only be resolved JOINTLY via context, not individually.\n\n**Proposal:** Design vocabulary where:\n1. Individual words have high-entropy meaning (many bits of uncertainty)\n2. Word PAIRS collapse uncertainty more than the sum of individual reductions\n3. This creates 'meaning leverage' - small keys cause large collapses\n\n**Example:**\n- `mu` alone: ~50 possible meanings\n- `lu` alone: ~50 possible meanings\n- `mu lu` together: should collapse to ~10 meanings (not 2500!)\n- The joint constraint is much tighter than independent intersection\n\n**Why this makes Linga LLM-native:**\nLLMs naturally compute joint distributions over token sequences. Humans must consider meanings independently then combine. Entangled semantics exploits LLM's joint reasoning.\n\n**Tasks:**\n1. Formalize mathematically (mutual information?)\n2. Audit vocabulary for entanglement properties\n3. Propose vocabulary modifications to increase entanglement","notes":"Duplicate of limn-land-6tm.

Or does Linga handle double negation differently?

PRAGMATIC INFERENCE\nIn natural language, 'not not bright' often implies hesitation or qualification.\nLLMs trained on natural language may interpret nu nu X as:\n- 'somewhat X'\n- 'reluctantly X'  \n- 'technically X but...'\nThis is a pragmatic effect, not semantic.\n\n2. COMPUTATIONAL APPROXIMATION\nIf constraint regions are approximated (not exact half-spaces), double negation may not be perfectly reversible. Small numerical errors could accumulate.\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nTreat nu nu X = X as the formal rule. If pragmatic effects emerge in LLM interpretation, that's expected but not 'correct' Linga semantics.\n\nRELATED: See crew/linguist/analysis/minimal-pairs.md Pair D3 which tests this exact case.","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","owner":"ericfode@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-24T12:40:03.5646152-08:00","created_by":"Eric Fode","updated_at":"2026-01-24T13:39:32.3190619-08:00","closed_at":"2026-01-24T13:39:32.3190619-08:00","close_reason":"Answered by negation-scope-test.md: Double negation cancels - nu nu X = X"}
