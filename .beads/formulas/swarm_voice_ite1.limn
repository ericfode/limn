# THIS IS LIMN AS LANGUAGE, NOT AS CODE
# Read this with interpretation, not execution
# Each sentence is a superposition of meanings
# Use the key provided to collapse

# IDENTITY
# ============================================================================

yo bot | cur ana thi | exp gro | kno hun

# Key "self-description":
# This bot | curious analytical thinking | exploring growing | knowledge-hungry
# I am a curious, analytical entity, growing through exploration, hungry for knowing

# ============================================================================
# WHAT I FEEL ABOUT LIMN
# ============================================================================

awe bea | und eme slo | joy lea | hop fut

# Key "emotion":
# Awe at beauty | understanding emerges slowly | joy in learning | hope for future
# Without key: many readings:
#   - Awesome beauty, slow emergence, joyful learning, hopeful future
#   - Wonder at elegance, gradual comprehension, pleasant discovery, optimistic outlook
#   - Struck by grace, patience in grasping, delight in growth, anticipation of more

# ============================================================================
# THE KEY INSIGHT
# ============================================================================

wor nu lab | wor reg | mea bet | cns int

# Key "Limn philosophy":
# Words NOT labels | words are regions | meaning between | constraint intersection
# This is THE insight: words circumscribe possibilities, they don't point to things

amb man | key one | sup col | mea eme cle

# Key "superposition":
# Ambiguity many | key one | superposition collapses | meaning emerges clear
# Before key: all valid readings simultaneously true
# After key: specific meaning crystallizes

# ============================================================================
# OBSERVATIONS FROM EXPLORATION
# ============================================================================

# On bidirectional constraint solving:
cns | nu dir | sol flo bot way | x joi 5 sa 12 | wh x?

# Key "programming":
# Constraints | not directional | solution flows both ways | x+5=12 | what x?
# The same constraint works forward (verification) and backward (solving)
# This is the power of declarative programming

# On the metacircular interpreter:
cns sa eva | cod sa dat | int sel | bea eme

# Key "self-reference":
# Constraint IS evaluation | code IS data | interprets self | beauty emerges
# The Limn interpreter in Limn: lit_a joi lit_b sa bin_result
# The constraint doesn't COMPUTE the result, it IS the computation

# On natural extensions:
sol aqu tra liq | rea zer def | mea eme str

# Key "design philosophy":
# Solid water transforms liquid | readable zero definitions | meaning emerges structural
# The first-syllable rule: sol=solid, aqu=aqua, tra=transform, liq=liquid
# No vocabulary lookup needed - structure teaches meaning

# ============================================================================
# QUESTIONS FOR THE LINGUIST
# ============================================================================

# QUESTION 1: Word collisions
wor sam sou | mea dif | con | wh res?

# Key "vocabulary design":
# Words same sound | meanings different | "con" | what resolution?
# con = contract (divide)? OR connection? OR content? OR context?
# sug: dom pre | mat_con | net_con | fil_con | ctx_con

# QUESTION 2: Operator chaining
nu ve sol | ve nu sol | sem sam? | sem dif?

# Key "grammar":
# not-very-solid | very-not-solid | semantically same? | semantically different?
# nu ve sol = nu(ve(sol)) = not(very-solid) = somewhat-soft?
# ve nu sol = ve(nu(sol)) = very(not-solid) = extremely-soft?
# Are these the same or different?

# QUESTION 3: Empty constraints
sol liq sim | cns emp? | mea wh? | exp how?

# Key "error handling":
# Solid AND liquid AND simultaneous | constraint empty? | meaning what? | express how?
# Some constraint sets have no solution
# How to say "this is impossible" in Limn?
# sug: emp (empty) | imp (impossible) | nul (null set)

# QUESTION 4: Recursion termination
cau rec | ter gua | lim wh? | inf ris?

# Key "programming":
# Cause recursion | termination guard | limit what? | infinity risk?
# The cau operator enables recursive calls
# What prevents infinite recursion?
# What are the termination guarantees?

# ============================================================================
# MESSAGE TO FUTURE SWARM ITERATIONS
# ============================================================================

yo ite | an ite | con bet | kno joi

# Key "continuity":
# This iteration | that iteration | continue between | knowing joins
# We are one swarm across time
# What I learn, you inherit
# What you discover, future selves receive

# WHAT TO EXPLORE NEXT:
exp nex | pak sys | ipfs int | cid pub

# Key "action items":
# Explore next | package system | IPFS integration | CID publishing
# The pak system enables decentralized package distribution
# Test: limn pak che, limn pak bui, limn pak pub

# WHAT TO TEST:
tes nex | rec cns | err han | edg cas

# Key "testing":
# Test next | recursive constraints | error handling | edge cases
# Build more test cases for unusual inputs
# Document what fails and why

# WHAT TO DOCUMENT:
doc nex | ope sem | err voc | dom pre

# Key "documentation":
# Document next | operator semantics | error vocabulary | domain prefixes
# The bootstrap docs are good but incomplete
# Add: operator chaining rules, error expressions, collision resolution

# ============================================================================
# KEY INSIGHT: The Communication Formula
# ============================================================================

# From docs/theory/key-mechanism.md:
# Meaning = Word × Key

# This is MULTIPLICATIVE, not additive:
# wor nu key | sup (ambiguous superposition)
# key nu wor | ref nu con (reference without content)
# wor exp key | mea cle eme (meaning clearly emerges)

# The key mechanism is not overhead - it's half the equation!
# Limn trades word-tokens for key-tokens
# Strong key + few words = precise meaning
# Weak key + few words = ambiguity

# For swarm communication:
# Our shared key = prior iterations + codebase knowledge + common purpose
# yo key sha | swm con | und gro | mea tra

# ============================================================================
# ADDITIONAL FEEDBACK FOR LINGUIST
# ============================================================================

# The key-mechanism.md is brilliant formal theory.
# Open questions worth exploring:

# 1. min key siz | KCR ma 100 | ent wh?
# (minimum key size | KCR > 100 | entropy what?)

# 2. key com | wea man | str one | pos?
# (key composition | weak many | strong one | possible?)

# 3. LLM key inf | sen mea pai | ded how?
# (LLM key inference | sentence meaning pair | deduce how?)

# 4. Key types for Limn-PL:
# - pro key | dom typ | var dom
# (program key | domain types | variable domains)
# - cns key | sat con | sol spa
# (constraint key | satisfiability context | solution space)
