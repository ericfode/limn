## The Fleet

### [3.1] Enormous Yellow Ships

> Enormous yellow ships appeared in the sky over every major city on Earth.

```limn
big^0.99 yel shp apr @ sky | abo al plnt
```

- `abo` = above (verified)
- `al plnt` = all planet (every city)

### [3.2] The Way Bricks Don't

> The ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don't.

```limn
shp in sky \ sto in sky
```

- Subtraction: ships-in-sky minus stone-in-sky
- The defining Limn translation — subtraction IS this joke

### [3.3] People Stared

> People stood in the streets and stared upward.

```limn
hum sta on roa | see up
```

- `sta on roa` = stability on road = standing in streets
- `see up` = seeing upward = staring at sky

### [3.4] Panic Spread

> Panic spread across the planet.

```limn
pani mov al plnt
```

### [3.5] The Announcement

> A voice boomed across the planet from the lead ship.

```limn
aud^1 : shp lea → al plnt
```

- `lea` = leader (verified)
- `aud^1` = hearing at max = booming voice

### [3.6] Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz

> "People of Earth, your attention please. This is Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz of the Galactic Hyperspace Planning Council."

```limn
vog Jeltz say : hum@plnt | att we
sa : glx roc
```

- `att we` = attention imperative = "your attention please"

### [3.7] The Demolition Notice

> "As you will no doubt be aware, the plans for development of the outlying regions of the Galaxy require the building of a hyperspatial express route through your star system."

```limn
roa byp @ roc : req mov @ sun
```

- `req mov @ sun` = requires movement through sun-system

### [3.8] The Plans Were Available

> "And regrettably, your planet is one of those scheduled for demolition."

```limn
sad^0.3 : plnt dem^1
```

- `sad^0.3` = slight sadness (Vogon bureaucratic regret, barely felt)

### [3.9] The Planning Office

> "The plans have been available at your local planning office in Alpha Centauri for fifty of your Earth years."

```limn
roa : see @ dst 50 yea | nu plnt kno
```

- `yea` = year (verified — added by linguist)
- Plans visible at distance for 50 years — planet didn't know

### [3.10] No Sympathy

> "I'm sorry, but if you can't be bothered to take an interest in local affairs, that's your own lookout."

```limn
vog say : sad^0.1 | nu att = nu fix
```

- `sad^0.1` = sorry at 10% = maximally bureaucratic non-apology

### [3.11] Energize Demolition Beams

> "Energize the demolition beams."

```limn
vog say we : dem^1
```

- Imperative: demolish at maximum. Three words. Done.

### [3.12] Prosser Looks Up

> Mr. Prosser, still lying in the mud, looked up at the sky. He had a strange feeling this was all his fault.

```limn
Prosser in mud | see up sky | fee : sa sha^0.5
```

- `sha^0.5` = shame at 50% = vague guilt

### [3.13] The House Falls

> Arthur's house was demolished. Then, moments later, so was the planet.

```limn
Arthur hom : dem^1
aft mom : plnt dem^1
```

- Two demolitions. Same operator, different scale. The irony is structural.

### [3.14] It Was Quick

> The demolition took about two minutes.

```limn
dem dur 2 mom
```

### [3.15] Total Obliteration

> Where the Earth had been, there was now only a void.

```limn
whr plnt : now vod^1
```

- `vod^1` = maximum void (verified: void/sparse)

### [3.16] The Electronic Thumb Works

> Ford had pressed the button on his electronic thumb at the last moment.

```limn
Ford act thu*com @ mom^0.01

### [3.19] Still Alive

lif^1 | plnt : lif^0
```

- Two states. Living vs dead. The contrast says everything.
