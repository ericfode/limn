hat: str fee of nu wan and wan awa
joy: fee hap and goo
sad: fee bad and dow, opp of joy
fea: fee of dan mak you wan run
ang: str fee of mad, wan to fig or yel

## VOCABULARY GAPS FOUND:

# GAP 1: "think" (verb) - "thi" already means "thing"
# Need: new 3-letter word for the act of thinking
# Suggestion: "cog" (cognition), "pon" (ponder), "rea" (reason)?

# GAP 2: "reason" (verb) vs "reason" (noun/cause)
# "rea" could mean "read" OR "reason" - ambiguous
# Need: distinct words for "read text" vs "think logically"

# GAP 3: "want" vs "need" - both very primitive concepts
# wan: des to hav or do
# nee: mus hav to liv or fun
# But these feel like they need more primitive definitions

# GAP 4: Abstract concepts without physical basis
# How to define "good", "bad", "true", "false" in purely Limn terms?
# "goo: wha you wan" - but this is circular
# "tru: wha rea bei" - but "rea" (real) needs definition

# GAP 5: Modal verbs (can, must, should, may)
# can: bei abl to do
# mus: hav to do, no cho
# sho: wha goo to do
# But "abl" (able) needs definition, "cho" (choice) needs definition

## Layer 6: Social & Human

# Relationships
fri: per you lov and tru
foe: per you hat or fig
fam: gro of per rel by bir or mar
mar: joi of two per in lov and lif

# Social Actions
hel: do act tha mak oth thi bet
hur: do act tha mak oth thi wor
giv: mak oth per hav thi you hav
tak: mak you hav thi oth per hav
sha: let oth use thi you hav, hol tog

# Power & Status
pow: abi to mak cha or con oth
rul: hav pow ove gro, mak dec
fol: go wit oth per dec, nu lea
lea: go bef oth, mak pat or dec

## CRITICAL GAPS FOUND:

# GAP 6: "person" - how do you define in Limn?
# per: liv thi tha thi, tal, and...
# But this requires "thi" (think) which we don't have!

# GAP 7: Circular definitions everywhere
# "lov: str fee of car" - but "car" (care) needs "lov" to define!
# "und: kno mea" - but "kno: und tru"! Circular!

# GAP 8: Psychological states without physical referents
# "tru" (trust), "hop" (hope), "bel" (believe) - all require complex mental concepts
# These may be indefinable at this bootstrap level

## Layer 7: Philosophy (Testing the Limits)

# Buddhist Terms
kar: act wit cau tha lea to eff in fut lif
dha: tru of how thi rea bei, cos law
sam: cyc of bir, die, bir aga wit nu end
nir: sta of end suf, fre fro sam, pea bey wan

# MAJOR GAP FOUND:
# GAP 9: "suffering" - no Limn word!
# suf: fee of pai, sad, or bad tha las
# But "pai" (pain) - how to define without "hur" (hurt)?
# "pai: fee in bod or min tha bad and wan to sto"
# But this uses "bad" which is undefined, "wan" which is undefined!

# Greek Terms
eud: sta of liv wel, flo of all par of hum lif
aret: exc in act, bei goo at wha per sho do
telo: end or pur of thi, why thi exi

# GAP 10: "purpose" vs "end" (both meanings of telo)
# How do you distinguish "the end of the story" from "the purpose of life"?
# Both use same concept of endpoint/goal

# Daoist Terms
tao: way of nat, pat of har tha all thi fol
wuw: act wit no for, flo wit nat, no try har
zir: spo way thi bei, nat wit no mak

# GAP 11: "natural" vs "artificial" - deep distinction
# nat: how thi bei wit no per mak
# But this requires "per" (person) which requires "thi" (think) which we can't define!

## STOPPING POINT: Circular Dependency Detected

# Cannot proceed without resolving fundamental gaps:
# 1. No word for "think" (verb) - "thi" is "thing"
# 2. Cannot define "person" without "think"
# 3. Cannot define abstract values (good, bad, true, false) without circular logic
# 4. Cannot define mental states (want, need, believe, hope) at this primitive level
# 5. Modal verbs (can, must, should) require undefined concepts (ability, obligation)

# BOOTSTRAP PARADOX IDENTIFIED:
# To define complex concepts, you need simpler concepts
# But the "simpler" concepts often require the complex ones!
# Example: "understand" requires "know", but "know" requires "understand"

# CONCLUSION:
# Successfully defined ~100 words using Limn-only definitions
# Hit fundamental limits at abstract/mental/social concepts
# Need vocabulary expansion or accept some primitives as undefined axioms
