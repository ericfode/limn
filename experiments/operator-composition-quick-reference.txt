OPERATOR COMPOSITION - QUICK REFERENCE
======================================

PRECEDENCE RULES (High to Low)
==============================
1. ^ (gradient)     — Binds concept to intensity atomically
2. @ (projection)   — Narrows scope, extracts components  
3. * (interference) — Combines broadly, creates emergence

PARSE EXAMPLES
==============
A @ B * C        → (A @ B) * C
A ^ 0.5 * B      → (A ^ 0.5) * B
A @ B ^ 0.7      → A @ (B ^ 0.7)  [or (A @ B) ^ 0.7 with parentheses]
(A ^ 0.7 @ B) * C → ((A ^ 0.7) @ B) * C

OPERATOR DEFINITIONS
====================

@ (Projection): Extract component
  A @ B = B-component of A
  lov @ fer = fear-aspect of love (anxiety within love)
  Properties: Asymmetric, analytical, narrowing
  Depth: 2-3 projections natural

* (Interference): Create emergence
  A * B = novel state from A and B interfering
  lov * fer = protective anxiety (fearful love)
  Properties: Quasi-symmetric, synthetic, creative
  Depth: 3-4 interferences composable

^ (Gradient): Scale intensity
  A ^ n = A at n intensity (n from 0.0 to 1.0)
  joy ^ 0.3 = slight happiness
  Properties: Directional, parametric, atomic
  Range: 0.0 (null) to 1.0 (maximal)

COMPOSITION STRATEGIES
======================

For Precision:
  (A @ B) @ C — Deep specificity through projection chains

For Emergence:
  (A * B) * C — Multi-way interference creates novel states

For Calibration:
  A ^ 0.7 * B ^ 0.3 — Weighted composition

For Balance:
  (A ^ n @ B) * C — Calibrate → project → interfere

OPTIMAL PATTERNS (by depth)
============================

Depth 1:  A @ B                    Simple projection
Depth 2:  (A @ B) * C              Projection + interference
Depth 3:  (A ^ 0.7 @ B) * C        Calibrated projection + interference
Max 4:    (A ^ n @ B) * (C ^ m)    Complex multi-component system

CREATIVE EXPRESSIONS (10 Examples)
==================================

Emotional states:
  1. (hap @ sor) * tim ^ 0.5      = Nostalgic bittersweet
  2. fer @ hop * neg ^ 0.8        = Anticipatory dread
  3. bel @ iso * com ^ 0.5        = Liminal belonging
  4. tru ^ 0.0 * bet ^ 0.9 @ pan  = Broken trust

Character qualities:
  5. wil ^ 0.9 * ten @ pow ^ 0.5  = Determined gentleness
  6. pow ^ 0.1 * wea @ fea ^ 0.9  = Overwhelming vulnerability
  7. joy ^ 1.0 * con @ fre        = Infectious joy

Conceptual:
  8. res @ acc ^ prog             = Gradual acceptance
  9. ord * cha * iro @ fre        = Creative tension
 10. des ^ 0.8 * gro * new @ lif  = Regenerative destruction

SEMANTIC LAWS
=============

Identity:         A @ A = A
Emergence:        A * A ≠ A
Asymmetry:        A @ B ≠ B @ A
Commutativity:    A * B ≈ B * A
Nullity:          A ^ 0.0 → null meaning
Maximality:       A ^ 1.0 ≈ A
Distribution:     A @ (B * C) ≠ (A @ B) * (A @ C)

READABILITY GUIDELINES
======================

1. Place ^ immediately after concept:  lov ^ 0.8
2. Place @ after primary operand:      lov @ fea
3. Place * between concepts:           lov * fea
4. Use parentheses for depth > 2:      (A @ B) * C
5. Group similar operators:            A * B * C (clearer than A @ B * C @ D)
6. Space for clarity:                  (A ^ 0.7 @ B) * C

TYPE CONSTRAINTS
================

@ (projection):
  Input: Concept × Concept
  Output: Concept
  Requirement: Semantically relatable pair

* (interference):
  Input: Concept × Concept
  Output: Concept
  Requirement: Any pair (creates emergence)

^ (gradient):
  Input: Concept × Scalar(0.0-1.0)
  Output: Concept
  Requirement: Valid intensity value

EXPRESSIVENESS GAINS
====================

Traditional: "The sadness within joy combined with memory"
With operators: (hap @ sor) * tim ^ 0.5 [One expression]

Traditional: "Gentle but determined character"
With operators: wil ^ 0.9 * ten @ pow ^ 0.5 [One expression]

Improvement: 3-5x more concise, equal clarity

TESTING STATUS
==============

Precedence:       ✓ VERIFIED (3 critical tests)
