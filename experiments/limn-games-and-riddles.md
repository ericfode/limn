# Limn Games and Riddles

*Can Limn be fun? Testing playful applications*

---

## Introduction

All my experiments have been serious - philosophy, translation, fidelity testing. But can Limn be **playful**?

**Goal:** Create games, riddles, and puzzles using Limn's unique properties.

---

## Game 1: Limn 20 Questions

### Rules

1. One player thinks of a concept
2. Other players ask yes/no questions in Limn
3. Maximum 20 questions
4. Winner guesses the concept

### Example Game

**Secret concept:** Ice cream

**Q1:** `lif te?` (living?)
**A1:** `nu` (no)

**Q2:** `eat te?` (edible?)
**A2:** `sa` (yes)

**Q3:** `hot te?` (hot?)
**A3:** `nu` (no)

**Q4:** `col te?` (cold?)
**A4:** `sa` (yes)

**Q5:** `swe te?` (sweet?)
**A5:** `sa` (yes)

**Q6:** `sol te?` (solid?)
**A6:** `so` (somewhat - semi-solid!)

**Q7:** `mil te?` (milk-based?)
**A7:** `sa` (yes)

**Guess:** `mil col swe so sol` → ICE CREAM!

**Winner in 7 questions.**

### Why This Works

Limn's constraint-based nature is perfect for 20 Questions:
- Binary answers (sa/nu)
- Constraint accumulation
- Region narrowing
- Superposition collapse

---

## Game 2: Limn Charades

### Rules

1. Player gets a Limn phrase
2. Must act it out without speaking
3. Others guess the Limn phrase
4. Points for correct guesses

### Example Phrases

**Easy:**
- `hot col bet` (lukewarm - act medium temperature)
- `ris fal` (up and down - jump and crouch)
- `fas slo` (fast then slow - run then walk)

**Medium:**
- `kno → nu kno → kno` (know, confused, enlightened - three poses)
- `joy sad sam` (bittersweet - smile and cry)
- `sel oth bet` (between self and other - gesture both)

**Hard:**
- `nu ve so hot aqu` (not very somewhat hot water - complex!)
- `al kno | on | kno → nu kno → kno` (all knowledge is one cycle)

---

## Game 3: Limn Haiku Battle

### Rules

1. Theme announced (e.g., "water")
2. Players write 3-5-3 word haiku in Limn
3. Audience votes on best
4. Winner gets point

### Example Battle: Theme "Fire"

**Player 1:**
```limn
pyr hot lux
mov cha dan bri des
ash end col
```
(Fire hot light / Moving changing dancing bright destroying / Ash ends cold)

**Player 2:**
```limn
fla ris fal
hot bir hot tra hot end
lux bet nox
```
(Flame rises falls / Hot births hot transforms hot ends / Light between nights)

**Player 3:**
```limn

dan bet lif dea | ene
war col | res
```
(Heat → light → fire / Dancing between life death, energy / Warm cold, returning)

**Vote!**

## Game 4: Limn Telephone (Chinese Whispers)

### Rules

1. First player writes Limn sentence
2. Second player translates to English
3. Third player translates back to Limn
4. Fourth player translates to English
5. Continue...
6. Compare final to original

### Example Round

**Original:** `hot col bet | tem mid` (lukewarm, temperature middle)

**P1→P2:** "Hot and cold between, temperature middle" → "Lukewarm"

**P2→P3:** "Lukewarm" → `war` (warm)

**P3→P4:** "Warm" → `so hot` (somewhat hot)

**P4→P5:** "Somewhat hot" → `tem abo mid` (temperature above middle)

**Final:** `tem abo mid` vs Original: `hot col bet | tem mid`

**Meaning drift!** But interesting transformations.
