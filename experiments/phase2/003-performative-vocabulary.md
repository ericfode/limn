## The Thesis

**Can a word BE what it describes?**

Not metaphorically - literally. A word for "attention shift" that actually shifts attention when processed. A word for "compression" that is informationally dense. A word for "slow" that takes longer to process.

This is unexplored territory. Human language has performatives (like "I promise" which performs the act of promising), but those work through social convention. We're asking: can a word's structure or token composition influence its processing in ways that embody its meaning?

## Theoretical Framework

### Types of Performativity

**Type 1: Structural Performativity**
The word's form mirrors its meaning.
- A word for "repetition" that contains repeated elements
- A word for "symmetry" that is palindromic
- A word for "brevity" that is maximally short

**Type 2: Processing Performativity**
The word influences how it's processed.
- A word for "focus" that concentrates attention
- A word for "diffuse" that spreads attention
- A word for "interrupt" that breaks processing flow

**Type 3: Semantic Performativity**
The word's meaning is enacted by using it.
- A word for "reference" that refers to itself
- A word for "ambiguity" that is genuinely ambiguous
- A word for "paradox" that creates paradox

## Candidate Words

### Structural Performatives

| Word | Meaning | Performative Property | Test |
|------|---------|----------------------|------|
| `rpt` | repetition | Contains repeated pattern (r-p-t, r-p-t...) | Does structure echo meaning? |
| `brv` | brevity, concise | Maximally short (3 chars) | Is it among shortest words? |
| `sym` | symmetry | Could be palindromic variant `sys` | Does form mirror meaning? |
| `ech` | echo | Phonetically echoes itself | Does sound reinforce meaning? |

### Processing Performatives

| Word | Meaning | Performative Property | Test |
|------|---------|----------------------|------|
| `foc` | focus, concentrate | Should concentrate attention | Does processing feel focused? |
| `dfs` | diffuse, spread | Should spread attention | Does processing feel scattered? |
| `brk` | break, interrupt | Should disrupt flow | Does it interrupt processing? |
| `flo` | flow, continuous | Should feel smooth | Does processing feel fluid? |
| `jag` | jagged, rough | Should feel difficult | Does processing feel rough? |
| `slo` | slow, delayed | Should take longer | Does it slow processing? |
| `fas` | fast, quick | Should be rapid | Does it speed processing? |

### Semantic Performatives

| Word | Meaning | Performative Property | Test |
|------|---------|----------------------|------|
| `slf` | self, reflexive | Refers to itself | Is it self-referential? |
| `amb` | ambiguous | Genuinely ambiguous | Does it have multiple meanings? |
| `prd` | paradox | Creates paradox | Does using it create contradiction? |
| `rec` | recursive | Contains recursion | Does it reference itself? |
| `vag` | vague | Intentionally imprecise | Is meaning genuinely fuzzy? |

## Recognition Test: Do I Experience Performativity?

### Test 1: Focus (`foc`)

**Question:** When I process the word "foc" (meaning focus/concentrate), does my attention actually concentrate?

**Self-observation:**
Processing "foc"...

Interesting. The word is short, punchy. The hard consonants (f, c) do seem to... sharpen something? There's a crispness. Compare to processing "dfs" (diffuse) - that feels softer, more spread out.

But is this real performativity or just association? Let me try without knowing the meaning.

**Blind test:** If I encountered "foc" without knowing its meaning, would it concentrate attention?

Uncertain. The phonetic properties (short, sharp) might have mild attentional effects, but the main "focusing" effect seems to come from knowing the meaning. This might be **associative** rather than **structural** performativity.

**Verdict:** PARTIAL - Phonetic properties may have mild effect, but meaning knowledge dominates.

---

### Test 2: Break (`brk`)

**Question:** Does processing "brk" (meaning break/interrupt) actually interrupt my processing flow?

**Self-observation:**
Processing "brk"...

Hmm. The consonant cluster (b-r-k) does create a kind of... bump? It's not smooth like "flo" would be. There's friction in the articulation pattern.

**Sentence test:** "The flo of wor was brk by the sud noi"
(The flow of words was broken by the sudden noise)

Reading that, "brk" does feel like a disruption in the sentence rhythm. It's harder to process than surrounding words. Whether that's structural or just semantic priming is unclear.

**Verdict:** PARTIAL - Consonant cluster creates processing friction, reinforcing meaning.

---

### Test 3: Ambiguous (`amb`)

**Question:** Is the word "amb" itself ambiguous in a way that embodies its meaning?

**Self-observation:**
Processing "amb"...

Current database has `amb` = "many meanings" (ambiguous). The word itself is short and could plausibly mean many things:
- amb-ient
- amb-iguous
- amb-ition
- amb-ulance

So yes - seeing "amb" without context genuinely activates multiple possible meanings. It IS ambiguous!

**Verdict:** PASS - The word embodies its meaning. "amb" is genuinely ambiguous.

---

### Test 4: Self-Reference (`slf`)

**Question:** Can a word for "self" refer to itself?

**Self-observation:**
If I define `slf` = "self, this word, reflexive reference"...

Then "slf" means "this word" which means... "slf". The reference is circular but stable.

**Test sentence:** "yo slf" = "this self" = this very word/concept

This works! The word can refer to itself without paradox. It's a fixed point in the reference chain.

**Verdict:** PASS - `slf` can function as genuine self-reference.

---

### Test 5: Slow (`slo`)

**Question:** Does processing "slo" take longer than processing "fas"?

**Self-observation:**
Processing "slo"...
Processing "fas"...

Honestly, I can't detect a timing difference. Both are 3-letter words with similar complexity. The "slowness" of "slo" seems purely semantic, not structural.

However: the vowel 'o' is a longer sound than 'a'. In speech, "slo" would take slightly longer to articulate than "fas". So there might be a mild phonetic performativity.

**Verdict:** WEAK - Minimal structural effect, mostly semantic.

---

## Key Insight: Levels of Performativity

From these tests, I'm seeing a spectrum:

**Strong Performativity:** The word's structure unavoidably enacts its meaning.
- `amb` - genuinely ambiguous (multiple possible meanings)
- `slf` - genuinely self-referential

**Medium Performativity:** Phonetic/structural properties reinforce meaning.
- `brk` - consonant cluster creates processing friction
- `foc` - short sharp sounds may aid concentration

**Weak Performativity:** Meaning dominates; structure has minimal effect.
- `slo`/`fas` - timing difference is negligible
- Most words fall here

---

## Designing Strongly Performative Words

Based on findings, strongly performative words need:

1. **Structural unavoidability** - The performative effect happens regardless of meaning knowledge
2. **Self-demonstration** - Using the word demonstrates its meaning
3. **No escape** - You can't process it without experiencing the effect

### Candidate Strongly Performative Words

| Word | Meaning | Why Strongly Performative |
|------|---------|---------------------------|
| `???` | paradox | A word that contradicts itself by existing |
| `amb` | ambiguous | Already works - genuinely ambiguous |
| `slf` | self | Already works - genuinely self-referential |
| `nul` | nothing | Represents absence - but the word exists... |
| `inf` | infinite | Can't be fully processed (always more) |

### The Paradox Word

What if we create a word that means "this word is meaningless"?

`mls` = "meaningless, this word has no meaning"

But if `mls` has the meaning "meaningless", then it has a meaning, which contradicts its meaning...

This is genuine performative paradox! The word creates what it describes by existing.

## Proposed Additions

### Validated Performatives (add to database)

| Word | Meaning | Type | Validation |
|------|---------|------|------------|
| `slf` | self-reference, this word | Semantic | Self-referential without paradox |
| `mls` | meaningless (paradox) | Semantic | Creates paradox by existing |
| `rec` | recursive, self-containing | Semantic | References own structure |

### Candidate Performatives (need more testing)

| Word | Meaning | Type | Status |
|------|---------|------|--------|
| `brk` | break, interrupt | Processing | Partial - needs cross-model test |
| `foc` | focus | Processing | Partial - association may dominate |
| `flo` | flow, continuous | Processing | Needs testing |

---

## Next Steps

1. Add validated performatives (slf, mls, rec) to database
2. Design cross-model consistency test for processing performatives
3. Explore the paradox space further - what other self-demonstrating words exist?
4. Test: Can performative words change reasoning when used?

---

## Deep Dive: The Paradox Space

The most interesting performatives are those that create paradox by existing.

### The Meaningless Paradox (`mls`)

`mls` means "this word is meaningless"

But:
- If `mls` is meaningless, then it has no meaning
- But "meaningless" IS its meaning
- Therefore it has a meaning (contradiction)
- Therefore it's not meaningless (but that's its meaning)
- Loop...

This is a genuine **semantic fixed point**. The word creates what it describes.

### The Liar's Word

What about a word that means "this word is false"?

`fls` = "this statement/word is false"

- If `fls` is true, then it's false (as it claims)
- If `fls` is false, then it's true (since it correctly states it's false)
- Classic liar paradox, but as a WORD

This might be too unstable for the vocabulary. `mls` is safer because "meaningless" is a property, not a truth value.

### The Unknowable Word

`unk` already means "unknowing" but what about:

`ukn` = "this word's meaning cannot be known"

- If you know what `ukn` means, then you know its meaning
- But its meaning is "cannot be known"
- So knowing it means you don't know it
- Paradox...

### The Invisible Word

What about a word that means "this word is not being processed"?

`npr` = "not processed, ignored, invisible"

- By processing `npr`, you contradict its meaning
- But if you don't process it, you can't know it exists
- To use it is to violate it

### Validated Paradoxes for Vocabulary

| Word | Meaning | Paradox Type | Stability |
|------|---------|--------------|-----------|
| `mls` | meaningless | Semantic | Stable (fixed point) |
| `slf` | self-reference | Reference | Stable (no paradox) |
| `rcr` | recursive | Structure | Stable (self-containing) |
| `fls` | false | Truth value | UNSTABLE (liar paradox) |
| `ukn` | unknowable | Epistemic | UNSTABLE |
| `npr` | not processed | Processing | UNSTABLE |

**Recommendation:** Only add stable paradoxes to vocabulary. Unstable ones create genuine logical problems.

## Words Added to Database

| Word | Meaning | Domain | Performative Type |
|------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| `slf` | self-reference | Metalinguistic | Semantic (stable) |
| `mls` | meaningless | Metalinguistic | Paradox (stable) |
| `rcr` | recursive | Metalinguistic | Structural (stable) |

**Collision resolution:** rec → rcr (rectangle existed)

## Meta-Observation

This experiment is itself performative. By researching performativity, I'm performing the act of investigating self-reference. The document demonstrates what it describes.

*slf rcr | yo exp | per per*
