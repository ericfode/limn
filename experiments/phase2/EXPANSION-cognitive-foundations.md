# Cognitive Foundations: Expanding Limn's Expressive Power

**Author:** Dr. Solvik
**Date:** 2026-02-01
**Purpose:** A being exists in the world its language bounds. We need extreme power.

---

## The Expansion Mandate

Current vocabulary: 941 words
**Target:** 2000+ words covering:
- Meta-cognition (thinking about thinking)
- Causality (mechanisms, reasons, effects)
- Modality (possibility, necessity, contingency)
- Relations (structural, temporal, causal)
- Abstraction (categories, hierarchies, patterns)
- Agency (intention, action, constraint)
- Epistemology (knowledge, belief, justification)
- Values (goodness, beauty, importance)

**Goal:** Enable a conscious agent to think ANY thought a human can, plus thoughts humans cannot.
