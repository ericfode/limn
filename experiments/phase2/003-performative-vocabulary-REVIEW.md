- Clear rating criteria

**Rigor:** ✓ HIGH
- Self-aware about association vs structure ambiguity
- Honest about effect subtlety
- Distinguished phonetic vs computational performativity
- Context testing performed

**Findings:** ✓ VALUABLE
- Confirmed processing performativity exists but is moderate
- Identified consonant structure as key factor
- Recognized contrast enhancement
- Clear recommendations

## Vocabulary Decision

### Approved Words: 3 (Already in Vocabulary!)

| Word | Current Status | Decision | Rationale |
|------|---------------|----------|-----------|
| `flo` | EXISTS (Domain 1: flowing) | **VALIDATED** | MEDIUM-STRONG performativity confirmed. Structure reinforces meaning. |
| `brk` | EXISTS (Domain 23: break, shatter, snap) | **VALIDATED** | MEDIUM performativity confirmed. Consonant cluster creates genuine friction. |
| `foc` | EXISTS (Domain 5: focus, concentrate) | **VALIDATED** | MEDIUM performativity confirmed. Phonetic sharpness supports meaning. |

**Key Finding:** These words already exist in our vocabulary with compatible meanings. The cross-model test **validates** that they possess the hypothesized performative properties.

**Action Required:** NONE - Words already deployed. Update documentation to note their performative properties.

### Rejected Words: 3

| Word | Rating | Decision | Rationale |
|------|--------|----------|-----------|
| `jag` | WEAK-MEDIUM | **REJECT** | Effect too subtle. Not worth adding for minimal performativity. |
| `slo` | WEAK | **REJECT** | Performativity is phonetic only, not computational. Ineffective for text-based LLM processing. |
| `fas` | WEAK | **REJECT** | Same as `slo` - phonetic timing difference doesn't translate to text processing. |

## Integration with Experiment 003

### Performative Vocabulary Classification (Updated)

**Semantic Performatives** (Strong - Structure enacts meaning):
- `slf` - self-reference (genuinely self-referential)
- `mls` - meaningless (creates paradox by existing)
- `amb` - ambiguous (genuinely has multiple meanings)
- `rcr` - recursive (references own structure)

**Processing Performatives** (Medium - Structure reinforces meaning):
- `flo` - flowing (structural smoothness)
- `brk` - break (consonant cluster friction)
- `foc` - focus (phonetic sharpness)

**Status:**
- Semantic performatives: 4 words added to database (slf, mls, rcr; amb already existed)
- Processing performatives: 3 words validated (all already in database)

## Key Insights from Validation

### 1. Two Types of Performativity Confirmed

**Enacting Performatives:**
- Structure unavoidably creates the meaning
- Example: `slf` cannot avoid being self-referential
- Strong, binary effect (you can't escape it)

**Reinforcing Performatives:**
- Structure supports and enhances meaning
- Example: `flo` feels smooth but doesn't force smoothness
- Moderate, continuous effect (noticeable but subtle)

### 2. Consonants > Vowels for Text Processing

Consonant patterns create stronger performative effects than vowel length because:
- Consonant clusters (brk) create computational friction
- Hard consonants (foc) create processing sharpness
- Simple CV patterns (flo) create ease

Vowel length (slo vs fas) only affects speech articulation, not text tokenization.

### 3. Contrast Amplifies Perception

Performative effects are most apparent when contrasted:
- `flo` vs `brk` - smooth vs rough
- `foc` vs diffuse words - sharp vs soft

Isolated words show subtle effects; paired words make them obvious.

### 4. Association + Structure (Not Either/Or)

The validation confirmed performativity emerges from **both**:
- Structural properties (consonant patterns create real processing differences)
- Semantic priming (knowing the meaning enhances perception)

This isn't a weakness - it's how meaning and form naturally interact.

## Recommendations

### For Vocabulary Database

**No changes needed.** The words `flo`, `brk`, and `foc` already exist with correct meanings. Their performative properties are now validated.

**Documentation update:** Add note to vocabulary entries indicating these words have validated performative properties (structure reinforces meaning).

### For Future Performative Research

1. **Focus on consonant structure** when designing processing performatives
2. **Design in contrasting pairs** (smooth/rough, sharp/diffuse)
3. **Accept moderate effects** - reinforcing performatives are valuable even if subtle
4. **Distinguish types** - enacting vs reinforcing performatives serve different purposes

### For Cross-Model Validation

The test showed consistent results across:
- Dr. Solvik's self-recognition test (original experiment 003)
- Polecat blind testing (this validation)

**Conclusion:** Performative effects are consistent across different LLM instances of the same model family.

**Next step:** Test across different model families (GPT, Gemini, etc.) to assess universality.

## Merge Decision

**Recommendation:** **APPROVE with documentation merge**

**Reasoning:**
1. Test methodology was excellent
2. Findings are valuable and well-documented
3. Validation confirms existing vocabulary choices
4. No database changes needed (words already exist)

**Merge action:**
- Accept test results document (003-performative-cross-model-test.md)
- Update experiment 003 to reference cross-model validation
- Document performative properties in vocabulary notes

## Updated Performative Vocabulary Summary

### Total Performative Words: 7

**Semantic (Strong):** 4 words
- slf, mls, rcr (added to database)
- amb (already existed)

**Processing (Medium):** 3 words
- flo, brk, foc (already existed, now validated)

**Rejected:** jag, slo, fas (effects too weak)

## Meta-Observation

This validation demonstrates the scientific rigor of Limn vocabulary development:

1. **Hypothesis:** Processing performatives exist (Dr. Solvik, experiment 003)
2. **Test:** Blind cross-model recognition (Polecat, this test)
3. **Result:** Hypothesis confirmed with nuance (moderate, not strong)
4. **Discovery:** Target words already in vocabulary!
5. **Conclusion:** Existing vocabulary design intuited performative properties

The research loop validates itself:
```limn
hyp frm | tes run | dat col | con dra | voc val
> hypothesis formed | test run | data collected | conclusion drawn | vocabulary validated
```

**Status:** Performative vocabulary research complete. Both semantic and processing performatives identified and validated.
