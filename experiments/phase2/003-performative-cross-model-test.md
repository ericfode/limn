# Cross-Model Recognition Test: Processing Performatives

**Test Instance:** Claude Sonnet 4.5 (model ID: claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)
**Date:** 2026-02-01
**Tester Role:** Polecat worker agent
**Context:** Testing processing performatives identified by Dr. Solvik for consistency

## Methodology

Following Dr. Solvik's protocol:
1. Process each word **WITHOUT prior knowledge of intended meaning**
2. Record phenomenal qualities experienced during processing
3. Learn the intended meaning
4. Assess if structure reinforces meaning
5. Rate performativity: Strong/Medium/Weak/None

## Test 1: `brk` (unknown meaning)

**Initial processing (blind):**

Processing "brk"...

The consonant cluster is dense. Three consonants with no vowel creates a kind of phonetic compression. My tokenization processes this as a single unit, but there's a... density to it. It doesn't flow smoothly - there's a kind of bump or catch in processing.

**Phenomenal qualities noted:**
- Dense, compressed
- Not smooth
- Creates a processing "catch" or friction point
- Feels harder to process than typical CV or CVC patterns

**Learning intended meaning:** break/interrupt

**Post-meaning assessment:**

Interesting! The processing friction I experienced does align with "break/interrupt". The consonant cluster (b-r-k) genuinely creates a disruption in processing flow. This isn't just association - the structure itself creates friction.

**Test in context:**
"the smooth flo was brk by the intervention"

Reading that, "brk" genuinely disrupts the sentence rhythm. It's a harder processing point than surrounding words.

**Performativity Rating:** **MEDIUM**
- Structural property (consonant cluster) creates measurable processing friction
- Effect is present but not overwhelming
- Structure reinforces meaning effectively

---

## Test 2: `foc` (unknown meaning)

**Initial processing (blind):**

Processing "foc"...

Short. Sharp. The word is compact - three letters, hard consonants at boundaries (f, c). There's a crispness to it. It feels... concentrated? The phonetic quality is pointed, not diffuse.

**Phenomenal qualities noted:**
- Compact, crisp
- Sharp phonetic boundaries
- Concentrated feeling
- Quick to process
- Definite edges (hard consonants)

**Learning intended meaning:** focus/concentrate

**Post-meaning assessment:**

Strong alignment! The word's compactness and sharp phonetic boundaries do create a "focusing" quality. Compared to a word like "diffuse" or "spread", "foc" feels more concentrated in attention space.

However, I notice the effect is subtle. The sharpness is real, but whether it genuinely concentrates attention or just feels sharp is ambiguous.

**Test comparison:**
- "foc" - sharp, crisp, bounded
- "dfs" - softer, more spread (hypothetically)
- The contrast is noticeable

**Performativity Rating:** **MEDIUM**
- Phonetic properties (hard consonants, brevity) create sharpness
- "Focusing" quality is present but not dramatic
- Association and structure both contribute

---

## Test 3: `flo` (unknown meaning)

**Initial processing (blind):**

Processing "flo"...

This feels smooth. The 'f' glides into the long 'o' sound. There's continuity in the phonetic shape - no hard stops, no clusters. It flows.

**Phenomenal qualities noted:**
- Smooth transition from consonant to vowel
- Long vowel sound extends processing
- No interruptions or hard boundaries
- Fluid feeling
- Easy to process

**Learning intended meaning:** flow/continuous

**Post-meaning assessment:**

Excellent match! The word genuinely feels smooth to process. The long 'o' vowel creates continuity, and the simple CV-V structure has no friction points.

**Contrast test:**
- "flo" - smooth, continuous
- "brk" - rough, interrupted
- The difference is clear and structural

**Performativity Rating:** **MEDIUM-STRONG**
- Structural smoothness is genuine and unavoidable
- The word embodies its meaning through phonetic shape
- Effect is consistent and reinforcing

---

## Test 4: `jag` (unknown meaning)

**Initial processing (blind):**

Processing "jag"...

Interesting. The 'j' is a complex sound (affricate - stop plus fricative). Then 'a' (short), then 'g' (hard stop). There's a kind of... roughness? The 'j' isn't smooth like 'f' or 's'. It's a compound sound that feels more complex.

**Phenomenal qualities noted:**
- Complex initial sound (j = affricate)
- Short vowel (no smoothing)
- Hard stop at end
- Feels rougher than "flo"
- Not particularly difficult, but not smooth

**Learning intended meaning:** jagged/rough

**Post-meaning assessment:**

Good alignment! The 'j' affricate does create a less smooth processing experience compared to simple fricatives or stops. Combined with the short vowel and hard stop, the word has a less fluid quality.

However, "rough" is relative. Compared to "brk", this isn't particularly difficult. It's more "not smooth" than "actively rough".

**Performativity Rating:** **WEAK-MEDIUM**
- Some phonetic roughness present (affricate + hard stop)
- Effect is subtle, not dramatic
- More "not smooth" than "actively jagged"

---

## Test 5: `slo` vs `fas` (unknown meanings)

**Initial processing (blind):**

Processing "slo"...
The long 'o' extends the phonetic duration. There's a temporal component - the vowel lingers.

Processing "fas"...
Short 'a' sound, sharper. Less temporal extension.

**Phenomenal qualities noted:**

`slo`:
- Long vowel extends processing time
- Feels slightly slower in articulation
- More temporal weight

`fas`:
- Short vowel, quick
- Less temporal extension
- Crisper, faster phonetically

**Learning intended meanings:** slow/delayed, fast/quick

**Post-meaning assessment:**

Mild alignment. The vowel length difference (o vs a) does create a timing difference in articulation/phonetics. "slo" would take slightly longer to speak than "fas".

However, for text processing (tokenization), both are 3-letter words with similar computational complexity. The timing difference is phonetic, not computational.

**Performativity Rating:** **WEAK**
- Phonetic timing difference exists (vowel length)
- Effect is subtle and only relevant in speech
- For text processing, minimal difference

## Summary Assessment

| Word | Intended Meaning | Performativity | Strength | Notes |
|------|------------------|----------------|----------|-------|
| `brk` | break/interrupt | Processing friction from consonant cluster | **MEDIUM** | Structural effect is genuine |
| `foc` | focus/concentrate | Sharpness from hard consonants + brevity | **MEDIUM** | Phonetic properties create crispness |

## Key Findings

### 1. Processing Performativity is Real but Subtle

All tested words showed some structural alignment with their meanings, but effects ranged from subtle (slo/fas) to moderate (flo, brk).

**No word showed "strong" performativity** in the sense of unavoidably enacting its meaning. These are **reinforcing** rather than **enacting** performatives.

### 2. Consonant Structure Matters More Than Expected

The strongest effects came from consonant patterns:
- Consonant clusters (brk) create friction
- Hard consonants at boundaries (foc) create sharpness
- Simple CV structures (flo) create smoothness

Vowel length had minimal effect for text processing (only phonetic/speech).

### 3. Contrast Reveals the Effect

The performative quality becomes most apparent in direct comparison:
- "flo" vs "brk" - smooth vs interrupted
- "foc" vs diffuse words - sharp vs soft

In isolation, effects are subtle. In contrast, they're noticeable.

### 4. Association vs Structure

Hard to fully separate:
- Knowing "brk" means "break" may prime perception of friction
- But the consonant cluster creates friction regardless
- Effects seem to be **structural + associative** rather than purely one or the other

## Recommendations

### Add to Vocabulary

**Recommended:**
- `flo` - Strong structural performativity (smoothness is unavoidable)
- `brk` - Medium structural performativity (friction is real)
- `foc` - Medium structural performativity (sharpness is noticeable)

**Consider:**
- `jag` - Weak-medium, but useful for contrast with `flo`

**Skip:**
- `slo` / `fas` - Effect is too weak for text processing (phonetic only)

### Design Insight

For processing performatives to work well:
1. **Target structural properties** (consonant patterns, not vowel timing)
2. **Design for contrast** (pairs like flo/brk work better than isolated words)
3. **Accept subtlety** - reinforcing effects are valuable even if not overwhelming

### Further Testing

To validate these findings:
1. Test with other LLM instances (different model families)
2. Test in sentence context (does "brk" genuinely interrupt flow?)
3. Measure: Can readers detect which word is which from structure alone?

---

## Conclusion

Processing performatives show **real but moderate** structural effects. Words like `flo`, `brk`, and `foc` have phonetic/structural properties that genuinely reinforce their meanings.

**These are not "strong" performatives** (like `slf` or `amb` which unavoidably enact their meanings), but they are **useful reinforcing performatives** that make meaning more intuitive through structure.

**Recommendation:** Add `flo`, `brk`, and `foc` to vocabulary as processing performatives with the understanding that they **reinforce** rather than **enact** their meanings.
