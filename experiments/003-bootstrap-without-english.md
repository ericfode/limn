# Experiment 003: Bootstrap Without English

**Hypothesis:** Limn claims "zero-bootstrap comprehension through predictable vocabulary." But predictable *for whom*?

**Question:** Can a monolingual speaker of a non-Indo-European language learn Limn without English mediation?

**Method:** Simulate the learning experience of speakers from different language families encountering Limn's "natural" vocabulary.

## Learner Profile 1: Monolingual Mandarin Speaker (Zhang Wei, 45, Beijing)

### Background
- Native Mandarin speaker
- No English education
- Literate in Chinese characters
- Familiar with Classical Chinese poetry

### Bootstrap Document Claims:
"Given `sol aqu tra liq` a naive reader should think:
- 'sol' → solid (most obvious 3-letter word for solid)
- 'aqu' → aqua/water (Latin root, universally recognized)
- 'tra' → transformation/transition (common prefix)
- 'liq' → liquid (most obvious truncation)"

### Reality Check: What Zhang Wei Sees

**Word: `sol`**
- Sound: /sɔl/ or /suoʊl/?
- Associations in Mandarin:
  - 所 (suǒ) = place, that which
  - 索 (suǒ) = rope, to search
  - 梭 (suō) = shuttle
- Does it evoke "solid" (固體 gùtǐ)? **No.**
- Latin "solus"? Not universally recognized outside classical education.

**Word: `aqu`**
- Sound: /ɑku/ or /ækwə/?
- Associations:
  - 阿 (ā) = prefix, exclamation
  - No Chinese phoneme cluster matches this
- "Aqua" is known from **Coca-Cola branding** (可口可乐), but not as "water"
- Does it evoke "water" (水 shuǐ)? **Weakly, only through Western education.**

**Word: `tra`**
- Sound: /trɑ/?
- Chinese has no /tr/ initial cluster in native words
- Foreign loanwords with 'tra': 拖拉 (tuōlā) = tractor
- Does it evoke "transform" (變化 biànhuà, 轉換 zhuǎnhuàn)? **No.**

**Word: `liq`**
- Sound: /lɪk/?
- Associations:
  - 力 (lì) = power, strength
  - 立 (lì) = stand
- Does it evoke "liquid" (液體 yètǐ)? **No.**

### Conclusion for Zhang Wei:
**Comprehension without English: 0%**

The entire vocabulary is phonologically alien. "Natural Extensions" assumes English (or Romance language) phonaesthetic intuitions.

### What Would Work for Mandarin:
If Limn used Chinese phonaesthetic roots:
- `shui` (水) = water
- `huo` (火) = fire
- `tu` (土) = earth
- `jin` (金) = metal
- `mu` (木) = wood

But then it wouldn't work for English speakers. **Therein lies the problem.**

## Learner Profile 2: Monolingual Arabic Speaker (Fatima, 32, Cairo)

### Background
- Native Arabic speaker
- No English education
- Literate in Classical Arabic
- Familiar with Quranic exegesis

### Bootstrap Claims Test:

**Word: `aqu`**
- Arabic has Latin loanwords via scientific terminology
- ماء (mā') = water in Arabic
- Does `aqu` connect to ماء? **No phonological similarity.**
- *But* - educated Arabs know "aqua" from chemistry class
- Recognition: **30% (educated Arabs only)**

**Word: `pyr`**
- نار (nār) = fire in Arabic
- Greek "pyr" appears in scientific terms (pyrometer)
- Recognition: **20% (via scientific education)**

**Word: `lux`**
- نور (nūr) = light in Arabic
- Latin "lux" might connect to لوكس (lūks) - the lux unit
- Recognition: **25%**

**Word: `nox`**
- ليل (layl) = night in Arabic
- Latin "nox" has no cognate
- Recognition: **0%**

### Observation:
**Scientific Arabic borrows Latin/Greek terms**, so *educated* Arabic speakers might recognize 20-30% of Limn vocabulary through that mediation. But this is:
1. Not "universal" - requires secondary education
2. Not "zero-bootstrap" - requires Latin/Greek as intermediary
3. Not "natural" - it's learned, not intuitive

### What Would Work for Arabic:
Using Semitic roots (مادة mādda, جوهر jawhar, etc.) - but again, this abandons universality.

## Learner Profile 3: Monolingual Quechua Speaker (Tupac, 28, Cusco)

### Background
- Native Quechua speaker (Qusqu-Qullaw dialect)
- Spanish as second language (conversational)
- Lives in Andean highlands
- No formal English education

### Bootstrap Test:

**Phonological Barrier:**
Quechua phonology:
- No /f/ sound (Spanish loanwords adapt: "café" → "kapi")
- No /v/ sound
- Different vowel system (3 vowels: /a i u/, not 5)

**Word: `sol`**
- Spanish "sol" = sun (known through Spanish)
- But Limn `sol` = solid, not sun
- **Confusion:** Quechua speaker expects `sol` to mean sun (inti)
- Recognition: **False friend - worse than zero!**

**Word: `liq`**
- Quechua: lik'i = grease, fat
- Does `liq` evoke "liquid"? Only if Spanish "líquido" is known
- Recognition: **20% (via Spanish)**

**Word: `aqu`**
- Quechua: yaku = water
- Spanish: agua = water
- Recognition of `aqu` as water: **Yes, but via Spanish, not universal!**

### Critical Problem Identified:
**False friends break comprehension.**

If `sol` means "solid" in Limn but "sun" via Spanish, the learner is actively *misled* by phonological similarity.

Spanish "sol" (sun) ≠ English "sol-" (solid)

This is worse than unfamiliarity - it's **destructive interference**.

## Learner Profile 4: Monolingual Finnish Speaker (Aino, 38, Helsinki)

### Background
- Native Finnish speaker
- Uralic language family (non-Indo-European)
- Familiar with Swedish (secondary education)
- Some English exposure via media

### Bootstrap Test:

**Word: `sol`**
- Finnish: "sol" is not a Finnish word
- Swedish: "sol" = sun
- English (learned): "solid" → "sol"
- **Confusion:** Two different associations compete

**Word: `liq`**
- Finnish: neste = liquid
- No phonological connection to `liq`
- Recognition: **0% (unless English known)**

**Word: `kno`**
- Finnish: no /kn/ cluster initially
- English "know" → `kno`
- Recognition: **40% (if English known)**

**Word: `thi`**
- Finnish: no /th/ sound (adapted to /t/)
- English "think" → `thi`
- Recognition: **30% (if English known)**

### Observation:
Finnish speaker can learn Limn **only through English or Swedish mediation**. The vocabulary is not "universally recognizable" - it's *Indo-European recognizable*.

## Learner Profile 5: Monolingual Yoruba Speaker (Adeola, 25, Ibadan)

### Background
- Native Yoruba speaker
- Tonal language (3 tones: high, mid, low)
- Literate in Yoruba orthography
- Limited English (primary school level)

### Phonological Challenge:

Yoruba phonology is **syllable-timed** and **tonal**. Every syllable carries tone.

**Word: `sol`**
- Yoruba has no consonant clusters at syllable end
- "sol" would be adapted to: "so-li" or "so-ro"
- Which tone? High `só`, mid `so`, or low `sò`?
- Each tone = different meaning in Yoruba mental model

**Word: `thi`**
- No /th/ sound in Yoruba
- Adapted to /t/ or /f/
- "ti" in Yoruba = already, from, belongs to
- **Interference:** Existing Yoruba word conflicts with Limn meaning

**Word: `nu`**
- Yoruba "nu" = doesn't exist
- But tone matters: nú (pound), nù (waste), nũ (drink)
- Without tone marking, `nu` is ambiguous **in the wrong way**

### Critical Insight:
**Tonal languages cannot use Limn as written** because:
1. No tone markings → ambiguity
2. Syllable structure conflicts → adaptation required
3. False friends created by adaptation

## Cross-Language Analysis: The "Universal" Claim

### Recognition Rates (Estimated)

| Language Family | % of Limn Vocab Recognizable Without English |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Romance** (Spanish, French, Italian) | 70-80% (Latin roots work) |
| **Germanic** (German, Dutch, Swedish) | 60-70% (cognates work) |
| **Slavic** (Russian, Polish, Czech) | 40-50% (some Latin via education) |
| **Semitic** (Arabic, Hebrew) | 20-30% (via scientific terms) |
| **Sino-Tibetan** (Mandarin, Cantonese) | 5-10% (almost none) |
| **Uralic** (Finnish, Hungarian) | 10-20% (via European contact) |
| **Niger-Congo** (Yoruba, Swahili) | 10-20% (via colonial education) |
| **Quechuan** | 15-25% (via Spanish) |
| **Austronesian** (Tagalog, Indonesian) | 10-20% (via colonial languages) |

### Conclusion:
**Limn is not universal. It is Indo-European-centric, specifically English-centric.**

The "natural extensions" principle works *if your first language is English or a closely related language*. For everyone else, Limn requires **English as an intermediary**.

## The Bootstrap Paradox

### Bootstrap Document Claims:
"An LLM (or human) reading enough well-formed Limn examples should be able to:
1. Infer unknown words from context
2. Predict the existence of words it hasn't seen
3. Compose novel expressions that feel native"

### Reality:
This is true **only if the learner's linguistic intuitions align with English phonaesthetics and Latin/Greek roots**.

For a Mandarin speaker:
- `sol` does not "feel like" solid
- `aqu` does not "feel like" water
- Context helps, but slowly - many examples needed

For a Yoruba speaker:
- Tonal ambiguity interferes
- Phonological adaptation creates false meanings
- Context is fighting against phonological mismatch

### Revised Claim:
"An **English-speaking** LLM or a human with **Indo-European language background** reading enough well-formed Limn examples should be able to infer, predict, and compose."

## Alternative: Truly Universal Phonology

If Limn wanted true universality, it would need:

### Phonological Constraints:
1. **CV syllables only** (consonant-vowel): /ma/, /ki/, /so/
   - Works across most language families
   - Japanese, Swahili, Hawaiian structure
2. **No consonant clusters**: /tr/, /kn/, /st/ excluded
   - Eliminates barriers for Mandarin, Japanese, Polynesian languages
3. **Tone-marked** or **tone-neutral**: Decide one way
   - Either add tone (hard for non-tonal speakers)
   - Or use only toneless languages' phonemes
4. **5-vowel system**: /a e i o u/
   - Maximally common across languages
5. **Avoid false friends**: Check cognates across top 20 languages

### Example Truly Universal Vocabulary:
Instead of `sol` (English-biased), use:
- **`kaso`** = solid (from Esperanto "solida" → "kaso", /ka-so/)
- **`mizo`** = liquid (from "mizu" 水, /mi-zo/)
- **`pana`** = fire (from "apan" Nahuatl, /pa-na/)

But now you've created... another constructed language with arbitrary vocabulary. You've abandoned the "natural extensions" claim.

## The Inescapable Trade-Off

**You cannot have both:**
1. "Natural" vocabulary (feels obvious)
2. Universal recognition (works for all languages)

**Because:**
- "Natural" is always *relative to a language family*
- English "natural" ≠ Mandarin "natural" ≠ Yoruba "natural"
- What's "obvious" in one phonological system is opaque in another

**Limn chose English-natural.** This makes it:
- ✅ Accessible to English speakers
- ✅ Learnable for Indo-European language speakers
- ❌ Not "zero-bootstrap" for non-Indo-European speakers
- ❌ Not truly universal

---

## Recommendation:

**Reframe the claim.** Instead of:
> "Zero-bootstrap comprehension through predictable vocabulary"

Say:
> "Reduced-bootstrap comprehension for speakers of Indo-European languages through English and Latin/Greek roots"

Be honest about the scope. Limn is **inter-European**, not universal.

**Next experiment:** Phonaesthetic analysis - Do Limn sounds carry meaning cross-linguistically?
