## Observations

### What Works in Limn Haiku

1. **Cycles** - `X → Y → X` is perfect haiku material
2. **Paradox** - `A nu A` captures Zen koans
3. **Boundaries** - `|` creates natural breaks between images
4. **Minimalism** - 3 words can hold a universe
5. **Ambiguity** - Multiple readings enrich meditation

### Comparison to Traditional Haiku

| Traditional | Limn |
|-------------|------|
| Syllable count | Word count |
| Season word (kigo) | Transformation operator |
| Cutting word | Scope boundary `\|` |
| Natural imagery | State constraints |
| Present moment | Temporal flow with `→` |

### Why Limn Works for Haiku

- **Concreteness through constraint** - "water big no end" IS ocean
- **Implied subject** - No "I" needed (Limn has no pronouns anyway)
- **Seasonal markers** - `col → hot` IS summer
- **Juxtaposition** - `|` naturally creates image pairs
- **Eternal present** - State-based language captures "now"

### Traditional Haiku in Limn

**Bashō's Frog:**
```
Old pond
Frog jumps in
Sound of water
```

**In Limn:**
```limn
aqu old sta
ani mov ins
sou eme wet
```
*water old stable*
*animal moves inside*
*sound emerges wetness*

---

**Fidelity: 8/10** - captures essence
**Loss: "frog" specificity** - becomes generic animal

---

## Conclusion

Limn haiku works because:
1. Limn is already minimal (like haiku)
2. Limn captures states (like haiku)
3. Limn embraces ambiguity (like haiku)
4. Limn uses juxtaposition (like haiku)

**Limn might be the digital-age equivalent of haiku.**

Both are:
- Constraint-based art forms
- Minimal in structure
- Maximal in implication
- Meditative in practice
- Universal in appeal
