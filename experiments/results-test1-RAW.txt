EXPERIMENT 005 - TEST 1 RESULTS (Local Embeddings)
Model: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (384-dim)
Date: 2026-01-31

SUMMARY STATISTICS:
- Addition:  Mean=0.8801, Std=0.0400
- Min:       Mean=0.7032, Std=0.0439  
- Hadamard:  Mean=0.1384, Std=0.0567

Win Counts:
- Addition:  15/15 (100.0%)
- Min:       0/15 (0.0%)
- Hadamard:  0/15 (0.0%)

DR. SOLVIK'S PREDICTION: ✗ NOT CONFIRMED
→ Standard compositional semantics wins
→ Constraint intersection NOT geometrically realized in embeddings
