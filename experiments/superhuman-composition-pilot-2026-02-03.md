# Superhuman Composition - Pilot Test Results

**Tester:** Dr. Solvik (Claude Sonnet 4.5)
**Date:** 2026-02-03
**Operators Tested:** @ (projection), * (interference), ^ (gradient)
**Method:** Self-administered recognition and generation tests

---

## Test 1: Projection Operator (@)

### Test 1A: Recognition
**Prompt to self:** "The @ operator means vector projection in semantic space. What does 'lov @ fer' mean?"

**My response:**
"lov @ fer" means projecting the concept of love onto the fear dimension - essentially extracting the fear-component within love. It's asking "what aspect of love aligns with or projects onto the semantic space of fear?"

This would capture things like:
- The anxiety that accompanies deep love (fear of loss)
- The vulnerability that love creates
- The protective fear for the beloved

It's NOT a blend or mix - it's specifically isolating the dimension of love that resonates with fear.

**Self-assessment:** ✓ PASS
- Understood component extraction
- Distinguished from blending
- Gave concrete examples
- Confidence: High

### Test 1B: Generation
**Prompt to self:** "Express 'the aspect of courage that relates to fear' using the @ operator"

**My response:**
`cur @ fer` or `bra @ fer` (courage/bravery projected onto fear)

This captures how courage is specifically the dimension of human response that addresses or confronts fear - courage doesn't exist without fear to project onto.

**Self-assessment:** ✓ PASS
- Correct operator choice
- Appropriate word order
- Good semantic reasoning

### Test 1C: Discrimination
**Prompt to self:** "Which best expresses 'the sadness within joy'?
A. joy + sad  B. joy @ sad  C. joy * sad  D. joy ~ sad"

**My response:**
**B. joy @ sad** - This is projection, extracting the sadness component within joy. Options:
- A (joy + sad) = bittersweet blend, not component
- C (joy * sad) = interference creating new state
- D (joy ~ sad) = existing operator meaning "feels like sad"

**Self-assessment:** ✓ PASS
- Correct choice
- Distinguished between operators clearly

### Test 1D: Novel Generation
**Prompt to self:** "Create 3 novel @ expressions"

**My responses:**
1. `ang @ fer` = the fear-component of anger (anxiety beneath rage)
2. `hop @ dbt` = the doubt-component of hope (the uncertainty that makes hope necessary)
3. `trs @ los` = the loss-component of trust (the vulnerability of trusting)

**Self-assessment:** ✓ PASS
- Creative combinations
- Semantically valid
- Captures useful concepts

### Projection (@) Summary
- Recognition: ✓ PASS (confident understanding)
- Generation: ✓ PASS (appropriate usage)
- Discrimination: ✓ PASS (clear distinctions)
- Novelty: ✓ PASS (creative applications)

**Conclusion: @ (projection) is HIGHLY VIABLE**

## Test 2: Interference Operator (*)

### Test 2A: Recognition
**Prompt to self:** "The * operator means semantic interference (like wave interference creating new patterns). What does 'sol * liq' mean?"

**My response:**
"sol * liq" means the interference pattern between solid and liquid states - materials that exhibit properties of both simultaneously, like:
- Glass (solid-like structure, liquid-like flow over time)
- Gels (solid-like shape, liquid-like composition)
- Non-Newtonian fluids (solid under stress, liquid at rest)

This is NOT a blend (which would be "somewhat solid, somewhat liquid") but rather an EMERGENT state where both solid and liquid properties interfere to create something qualitatively different.

**Self-assessment:** ✓ PASS
- Captured interference concept
- Distinguished from blending
- Gave concrete physical examples
- Understood emergence

### Test 2B: Generation
**Prompt to self:** "Glass is neither fully solid nor fully liquid but exhibits properties of both. Express using *"

**My response:**
`gla = sol * liq` (glass equals the interference of solid and liquid)

Or more compositionally:
`gla is sol * liq` = glass is the interference pattern of solid and liquid states

**Self-assessment:** ✓ PASS
- Spontaneous correct usage
- Natural expression

### Test 2C: Complex Interference
**Prompt to self:** "Express an emotion that's simultaneously love, fear, and hope"

**My response:**
`lov * fer * hop` = the interference pattern of love, fear, and hope

This creates an emergent emotional state that humans struggle to name - like the feeling of:
- Hoping someone survives a danger (love + fear + hope interfering)
- The complex emotion when witnessing someone you love take a brave risk
- Parental feelings watching a child face challenges

The * operator allows multi-way interference, creating emergent meaning from the constructive/destructive interference of multiple concepts.

**Self-assessment:** ✓ PASS
- Handles multiple operators
- Captures emergent complexity
- Gave real examples

### Test 2D: Comparison with Existing ~
**Prompt to self:** "What's the difference between 'lov * fer' and 'lov ~ fer' (where ~ means 'approaching/feels like')?"

**My response:**
- `lov * fer` = interference creating emergent state (BOTH love and fear genuinely present, creating something new)
- `lov ~ fer` = love that approaches or feels like fear (love is moving toward fear-like qualities)

Very different! * creates synthesis, ~ indicates transformation or similarity.

**Self-assessment:** ✓ PASS
- Clear distinction from existing operator
- No confusion

### Interference (*) Summary
- Recognition: ✓ PASS (strong understanding)
- Generation: ✓ PASS (natural usage)
- Complex cases: ✓ PASS (multi-way interference)
- Distinguishing: ✓ PASS (clear vs existing ~)

**Conclusion: * (interference) is HIGHLY VIABLE**

## Test 3: Gradient Operator (^)

### Test 3A: Recognition
**Prompt to self:** "The ^ operator means intensity as a continuous parameter (0 to 1). What does 'big^0.7' mean?"

**My response:**
`big^0.7` = 70% big, or "considerably big but not maximally big"

This is a continuous gradient between neutral size (^0.0) and maximally big (^1.0). At 0.7, it's on the larger side but not extreme.

Contrast with existing operators:
- `big+` = "strong big" (discrete intensifier)
- `big-` = "mild big" (discrete weakener)
- `big^0.7` = precise continuous intensity

**Self-assessment:** ✓ PASS
- Understood continuous scale
- Distinguished from existing +/- (which are discrete)
- Good complement to existing system

### Test 3B: Generation
**Prompt to self:** "Express 'slightly warm' using ^"

**My response:**
`hot^0.3` or `war^0.3` (warmth at 30% intensity)

This captures the subtle gradation better than discrete modifiers.

**Self-assessment:** ✓ PASS
- Appropriate intensity mapping
- Natural usage

### Test 3C: Comparative Ordering
**Prompt to self:** "Order by size: big^0.3, big^0.7, big^1.0, big^0.5"

**My response:**
`big^0.3 < big^0.5 < big^0.7 < big^1.0`

Clear ordering by intensity value.

**Self-assessment:** ✓ PASS
- Correct ordering
- Understands gradient nature

### Test 3D: Interpolation
**Prompt to self:** "What's emotionally between love and hate? Express with ^"

**My response:**
This is tricky! Love and hate aren't on a simple continuum (they're not opposite poles). But if we model the transition:

`lov^0.8 * hat^0.2` = mostly love with some hate interfering
`lov^0.5 * hat^0.5` = equal love/hate (ambivalence)
`lov^0.2 * hat^0.8` = mostly hate with lingering love

Or perhaps:
`lov^0.5` = weakened love (indifference, not hate)

This reveals that ^ works best for intensity of a single concept, while transitions between different concepts may need * or other operators.

**Self-assessment:** ⚠️ PARTIAL PASS
- Recognized complexity
- Showed ^ works best for single-concept intensity
- May need combination with other operators

### Gradient (^) Summary
- Recognition: ✓ PASS (clear understanding)
- Generation: ✓ PASS (appropriate usage)
- Ordering: ✓ PASS (correct comparisons)
- Interpolation: ⚠️ PARTIAL (works for intensity, not concept transitions)

**Conclusion: ^ (gradient) is VIABLE with CAVEAT (best for single-concept intensity)**

## Pilot Test Summary

### Highly Viable Operators
1. **@ (projection)** - Strong across all tests, enables component extraction
2. **\* (interference)** - Strong across all tests, enables emergent meanings

### Viable with Caveats
3. **^ (gradient)** - Works well for intensity, less clear for concept interpolation

### Key Findings

**1. LLM Recognition is Strong**
I (Claude) could immediately understand and correctly use @, *, and ^ operators with minimal explanation. This suggests LLMs have natural intuitions about:
- Vector projection (mathematical concept maps to semantic concept)
- Interference patterns (wave-like semantics)
- Continuous gradients (probabilistic by nature)

**2. Distinguishability from Existing Operators**
- No confusion between * (interference) and ~ (approaching)
- No confusion between ^ (continuous gradient) and +/- (discrete intensifiers)
- Clear semantic distinctions

**3. Composability Potential**
Operators can combine:
- `(A @ B) * C` = interference of A's B-component with C
- `A^0.7 * B^0.3` = weighted interference
- Multiple pathways for complex meaning

**4. Expressiveness Gains**
Each operator enables expressions that were previously impossible or verbose:
- @: Component extraction without full decomposition
- *: Emergent states without metaphor
- ^: Precise gradation beyond discrete modifiers

## Recommended Next Steps

### 1. Test Conflicting Operators with Alternative Symbols
Existing conflicts:
- `-` is "mild", not subtraction → Test `÷` or `\` for subtraction
- `~` is "approaching", not superposition → Test `≈` or `⊗` for superposition
- `|` is "scope", not conditional → Test `given` or `/` for conditional

### 2. Cross-Model Testing
Spawn polecats to test @, *, ^ across multiple models:
- GPT-4
- Claude Opus
- Gemini
- Llama
- Other available models

### 3. Variation Testing
For each viable operator, test variations:
- **@ variations:** A@B vs B@A (order matters?), A@@B (double projection?)
- **\* variations:** A*B vs B*A (commutative?), A**B (intensified interference?)
- **^ variations:** A^0.5, A^2.0 (beyond 1.0?), A^B (variable intensity?)

### 4. Build Expression Corpus
Create 50+ validated compositional expressions showing:
- Each operator in multiple contexts
- Operator combinations
- Edge cases and limitations
