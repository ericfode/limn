# Experiment 007: Western Philosophy Comparison

**Context:** Eastern philosophy achieved 93% fidelity with complete vocabulary (Experiment 006 retest). Does Limn express Western philosophy equally well?

**Hypothesis:** Western philosophy will score lower (~70-80%) than Eastern (93%) because we added Eastern-specific terms (tao, ren, wuw, kar, nir, etc.) but rely on generic virtue terms for Western philosophy (jus, pru, mer, pie, dil).

**Method:** Translate canonical Western philosophical texts using existing Limn vocabulary. Identify gaps.

## GREEK PHILOSOPHY

### Test Case 1: Plato - The Forms and Justice

#### Original Concept (Republic)
"Justice is doing one's own work and not meddling with what isn't one's own."

The Forms: eternal, perfect, unchanging ideals (the Form of the Good, the Form of Justice)

#### Limn Translation
```limn
jus: do own wor, nu med wit oth wor
```

**For the Forms:**
```limn
for: ete per ide bey phy wor
for of gud: hig tru, sou of all
for of jus: per ide of rit act
```

**Word by word:**
- jus = justice (we have this!)
- do = do
- own = own
- wor = work
- nu = not
- med = meddle
- oth = other
- for = form
- ete = eternal
- per = perfect
- ide = idea/ideal
- bey = beyond
- phy = physical
- hig = highest
- tru = truth
- sou = source

**Fidelity: 75%**

**Preserved:**
- Justice concept (jus!)
- Own work vs meddling
- Forms as eternal/perfect
- Hierarchy (Form of Good highest)

**Lost:**
- "Forms" as specific Platonic metaphysics (using "for" is generic)
- The Good as transcendent source
- Participation relationship (things participate in Forms)
- Cave allegory context

**Vocabulary Gaps:**
- Need "form/eidos" as specific philosophical term (not just "for")
- Need "Good" as abstract noun (the Good, not just "gud")
- Need "essence" vs "appearance"

---

### Test Case 2: Aristotle - Eudaimonia and Arete

#### Original Concept (Nicomachean Ethics)
**Eudaimonia:** Human flourishing, happiness, living well
**Arete:** Excellence, virtue (moral and intellectual)
**Phronesis:** Practical wisdom
**Telos:** Purpose, end, goal

"Eudaimonia is activity of soul in accordance with arete."

#### Limn Translation
```limn
gud lif: act of sel in way of exc
hap com fro liv wel wit vir
end of lif is flo and exc
```

**Word by word:**
- gud lif = good life (eudaimonia - but too weak!)
- act = activity
- sel = soul/self
- way = accordance
- exc = excellence (arete - generic!)
- hap = happiness
- liv = living
- wel = well
- vir = virtue (we have this!)
- end = purpose/telos
- flo = flourishing

**Fidelity: 60%**

**Preserved:**
- Activity of soul
- Accordance with virtue
- Purpose/end concept
- Flourishing idea

**Lost:**
- **Eudaimonia** as specific concept (not just "happiness" or "good life")
- **Arete** as excellence/virtue (using generic "exc" or "vir")
- **Phronesis** as practical wisdom (no term!)
- **Telos** as purpose/final cause (using generic "end")
- Intellectual vs moral virtues distinction

**Vocabulary Gaps (CRITICAL):**
- **eud** - eudaimonia (flourishing, living well, happiness)
- **are** - arete (excellence, virtue)
- **phr** - phronesis (practical wisdom)
- **tel** - telos (purpose, end, final cause)
- **nou** - nous (intellect, mind, understanding)

**Note:** These are THE core Aristotelian concepts. Without them, Aristotelian ethics is completely lost.

---

### Test Case 3: Aristotle - Nous and Logos

#### Original Concepts
**Nous:** Intellect, intuitive mind, understanding
**Logos:** Reason, word, rational principle

"The human soul has nous, which grasps first principles through logos."

#### Limn Translation
```limn
hum sel hav min, whi get fir pri thr rea
```

**Word by word:**
- hum = human
- sel = soul/self
- hav = has
- min = mind (nous - but too generic!)
- whi = which
- get = grasp
- fir = first
- pri = principles
- thr = through
- rea = reason (logos - but too generic!)

**Fidelity: 50%**

**Preserved:**
- Soul has intellect
- Grasps first principles
- Through reason

**Lost:**
- **Nous** as intuitive intellect (distinct from discursive reason)
- **Logos** as rational principle (cosmic and individual)
- The specific relationship between nous and logos
- First principles as foundations of knowledge

**Vocabulary Gaps:**
- **nou** - nous (intuitive intellect)
- **log** - logos (reason, word, rational principle)

**Impact:** Greek philosophy is BUILT on nous/logos distinction. Without these terms, we lose the entire epistemological framework.

---

## ROMAN STOICISM

### Test Case 4: Marcus Aurelius - Logos and Apatheia

#### Original Concepts (Meditations)
**Logos:** Universal reason, divine rational principle
**Apatheia:** Freedom from destructive passions (not apathy!)
**Oikeiosis:** Familiarization, cosmopolitan concern

"Live according to nature, which is to live according to logos."

#### Limn Translation
```limn
liv by nat, whi is liv by rea
fre fro bad emo, liv in pea
all hum are kin, par of one wor
```

**Word by word:**
- liv = live
- by = according to
- nat = nature
- rea = reason (logos - but too weak!)
- fre = freedom
- fro = from
- bad = destructive
- emo = emotions/passions
- pea = peace
- kin = kindred
- par = part
- one = one
- wor = world

**Fidelity: 65%**

**Preserved:**
- Living according to nature/reason
- Freedom from passions
- Universal kinship

**Lost:**
- **Logos** as cosmic rational principle (not just "reason")
- **Apatheia** as specific Stoic ideal (not just "peace" or "calm")
- **Oikeiosis** as cosmopolitan concern (no term!)
- Stoic physics/metaphysics

**Vocabulary Gaps:**
- **log** - logos (universal reason, divine principle)
- **apa** - apatheia (freedom from destructive passions)
- **oik** - oikeiosis (cosmopolitan familiarization)

---

## MEDIEVAL PHILOSOPHY

### Test Case 5: Aquinas - Faith and Reason

#### Original Concepts (Summa Theologica)
**Faith (fides):** Trust in divine revelation
**Reason (ratio):** Natural human intellect
**Grace (gratia):** Divine assistance
**Natural law:** Moral order discernible by reason

"Grace does not destroy nature but perfects it."

#### Limn Translation
```limn
fai nu des nat but mak per
god giv hel nu end rea but lif it
nat law: mor ord see by min
```

**Word by word:**
- fai = faith (we have this!)
- nu = not
- des = destroy
- nat = nature
- mak = make
- per = perfect
- god = God
- giv = give/divine
- hel = help/grace (but too weak!)
- end = end
- rea = reason
- lif = lift
- mor = moral
- ord = order
- see = discern
- min = mind

**Fidelity: 70%**

**Preserved:**
- Faith (fai!)
- Reason
- Grace as divine help
- Natural law as moral order

**Lost:**
- **Grace** as specific theological concept (gratia - transformative divine assistance)
- Faith vs reason relationship nuance
- Supernatural vs natural distinction
- Thomistic synthesis

**Vocabulary Gaps:**
- Need stronger "grace" term (not just "help")
- Need "revelation" as distinct from "knowledge"
- Need "supernatural" vs "natural"

---

## MODERN PHILOSOPHY

### Test Case 6: Kant - Categorical Imperative

#### Original Concept (Groundwork)
**Categorical imperative:** Act only according to that maxim whereby you can will that it should become a universal law.

**Duty (Pflicht):** Moral obligation from reason alone
**Autonomy:** Self-legislation of rational will

#### Limn Translation
```limn
cat imp: act on rul tha can be uni law
dut: mor obl fro rea, nu fro wan
aut: sel mak own mor law by rea
```

**Word by word:**
- cat imp = categorical imperative
- act = act
- on = according to
- rul = rule/maxim
- tha = that
- can = can
- be = become
- uni = universal
- law = law
- dut = duty (we have this!)
- mor = moral
- obl = obligation
- fro = from
- rea = reason
- wan = desire/inclination
- aut = autonomy (self-legislation)
- sel = self
- mak = make

**Fidelity: 80%**

**Preserved:**
- Categorical imperative structure
- Duty concept (dut!)
- Reason vs desire
- Autonomy as self-legislation
- Universal law test

**Lost:**
- "Categorical" vs "hypothetical" distinction
- Maxim as subjective principle
- Good will as only unqualified good
- Kingdom of ends

**Vocabulary Impact:**
- Works fairly well! Existing vocabulary (dut, rea, aut, mor, law) covers Kantian ethics reasonably.
- But missing nuance of Kantian technical terms.

---

### Test Case 7: Nietzsche - Will to Power

#### Original Concepts
**Will to power (Wille zur Macht):** Fundamental drive to assert and enhance one's power
**Übermensch:** Overman, higher human
**Eternal recurrence:** Cosmological test of life-affirmation

"What is good? All that heightens the feeling of power, the will to power, power itself in man."

#### Limn Translation
```limn
wha is gud? all tha ris fee of pow, wil to pow, pow in hum
wil to pow: cor dri to gro and rul
hig hum: one who mak own val, go bey gud and bad
```

**Word by word:**
- wha = what
- ris = rise/heighten
- fee = feeling
- pow = power
- wil = will
- cor = core
- dri = drive
- gro = grow
- rul = rule/dominate
- hig hum = higher human (Übermensch)
- one = one
- mak = make
- val = values
- go = go
- bey = beyond
- gud bad = good evil

**Fidelity: 75%**

**Preserved:**
- Will to power concept
- Power as fundamental
- Higher human who creates values
- Beyond good and evil

**Lost:**
- Übermensch as specific concept (not just "higher human")
- Eternal recurrence
- Master vs slave morality
- Amor fati
- Genealogy of morals method

**Vocabulary Gaps:**
- Could use "ubermensch" term (ube?)
- Need "amor fati" (love of fate)
- Need "ressentiment" (slave morality's resentment)

## SUMMARY OF RESULTS

| Tradition | Philosopher | Text | Fidelity | Key Missing Terms |
|-----------|-------------|------|----------|-------------------|
| Greek | Plato | Forms & Justice | 75% | eidos, the Good, essence |
| Greek | Aristotle | Eudaimonia | 60% | eud, are, phr, tel, nou |
| Greek | Aristotle | Nous & Logos | 50% | nou, log |
| Roman | Marcus Aurelius | Stoicism | 65% | log, apa, oik |
| Medieval | Aquinas | Faith & Reason | 70% | grace (stronger), revelation |
| Modern | Kant | Categorical Imperative | 80% | Works well! |
| Modern | Nietzsche | Will to Power | 75% | Übermensch, amor fati |

**Mean fidelity: 68%**

**Comparison:**
- Eastern philosophy: 93%
- Western philosophy: 68%
- **Difference: -25 percentage points**

**Hypothesis confirmed:** Western philosophy scores significantly lower than Eastern because we lack Greek/Latin philosophical vocabulary.

## VOCABULARY GAP ANALYSIS

### Critical Greek Terms (Missing)

| Missing | Greek | Meaning | Impact on Fidelity |
|---------|-------|---------|-------------------|
| **eud** | εὐδαιμονία | Flourishing, happiness | Aristotle 60%→90% |
| **are** | ἀρετή | Excellence, virtue | Aristotle 60%→90% |
| **phr** | φρόνησις | Practical wisdom | Aristotle 60%→85% |
| **tel** | τέλος | Purpose, end, final cause | Aristotle 60%→85% |
| **nou** | νοῦς | Intellect, intuitive mind | Aristotle 50%→85% |
| **log** | λόγος | Reason, word, principle | Multiple 50-65%→85% |
| **eid** | εἶδος | Form, essence | Plato 75%→90% |

### Terms That Work (Have in Vocabulary)

| Term | Concept | Used In | Works? |
|------|---------|---------|--------|
| **jus** | Justice | Plato | ✓ Yes |
| **vir** | Virtue | Aristotle, general | ✓ Yes |
| **dut** | Duty | Kant | ✓ Yes |
| **fai** | Faith | Aquinas | ✓ Yes |
| **rea** | Reason | Multiple | ⚠ Generic |
| **mor** | Moral | Multiple | ✓ Yes |

## EXPECTED IMPACT OF ADDITIONS

If we add the 7 critical Greek terms (eud, are, phr, tel, nou, log, eid):

**Predicted improvements:**
- Aristotle: 60% → 90% (+30%)
- Plato: 75% → 90% (+15%)
- Stoics: 65% → 85% (+20%)

**Overall Western philosophy: 68% → 87%**

This would put Western philosophy (87%) roughly equal to Eastern philosophy (93%), with the remaining gap due to less specialized vocabulary in other areas.

---

## COMPARISON: Eastern vs Western Vocabulary Strategy

**Eastern Philosophy:**
- We added complete semantic clusters
- Buddhist: nir, zen, kar, san, dha, ahi, duk, bod, sar
- Daoist: tao, wuw, zir
- Confucian: ren, lir, yir, xia, jnz
- Result: 93% fidelity

**Western Philosophy:**
- We have some generic virtue terms: jus, pru, mer, pie, dil, vir, dut
- Missing Greek technical vocabulary: eud, are, phr, tel, nou, log, eid
- Result: 68% fidelity

**Pattern:** Specialized philosophical vocabulary >> generic moral vocabulary

---

## KEY INSIGHT: The Eudaimonia Problem

**Aristotle's eudaimonia (60% → potential 90%) is EXACTLY like Sanskrit's ahimsa/dharma (40% → 95% after additions).**

**BEFORE additions:**
- Ahimsa → "nu har" (not harm) - 40%
- Dharma → "gud act" (good action) - 40%
- Eudaimonia → "gud lif" (good life) - 60%

**AFTER additions:**
- Ahimsa → "ahi" - 95%
- Dharma → "dha" - 95%
- Eudaimonia → (still) "gud lif" - 60%

**The problem is identical:** Core philosophical concepts cannot be expressed with generic descriptors. They need their own terms.

---

## KANTIAN SUCCESS CASE

**Why Kant worked better (80%):**
- Kantian concepts map to existing vocabulary:
  - Duty (dut) ✓
  - Reason (rea) ✓
  - Autonomy (aut) ✓
  - Law (law) ✓
  - Universal (uni) ✓

**Lesson:** When philosophical concepts align with existing vocabulary, fidelity is good. When they don't (eudaimonia, arete, nous, logos), fidelity drops.

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### High Priority (Core Greek Philosophy)

```limn
eud     Eudaimonia - flourishing, happiness, living well (εὐδαιμονία)
are     Arete - excellence, virtue (ἀρετή)
phr     Phronesis - practical wisdom (φρόνησις)
tel     Telos - purpose, end, final cause (τέλος)
nou     Nous - intellect, intuitive mind (νοῦς)
log     Logos - reason, word, rational principle (λόγος)
eid     Eidos - form, essence (εἶδος)
```

**Expected impact:** Western philosophy 68% → 87%

### Medium Priority (Stoic/Other)

```limn
apa     Apatheia - freedom from destructive passions
oik     Oikeiosis - cosmopolitan concern
ube     Übermensch - Nietzsche's higher human
amo     Amor fati - love of fate
```

### Low Priority (Nice to have)

- Specific terms for Platonic Forms
- Thomistic grace (stronger than current)
- Hegelian dialectic terms
- Phenomenological terms (Husserl, Heidegger)

---

## CONCLUSION

**Hypothesis confirmed:** Western philosophy (68%) scores 25 points lower than Eastern (93%) because Limn has Eastern-specific vocabulary but lacks Greek philosophical terms.

**The pattern repeats:** Just as ahimsa/dharma needed specific terms (not "nu har"/"gud act"), eudaimonia/arete need specific terms (not "gud lif"/"exc").

**Adding 7 core Greek terms would bring Western philosophy to 87% fidelity**, roughly matching Eastern philosophy's 93%.

**For LLMs:** LLMs trained on philosophy have rich embeddings for eudaimonia, arete, logos, nous, telos. Using abbreviated Limn forms (eud, are, log, nou, tel) would preserve this semantic density, just as Eastern terms (dha, kar, nir) do.

**Recommendation:** Add core Greek philosophical vocabulary to achieve parity between Eastern and Western philosophical expressiveness.
