OPERATOR COMPOSITION TEST RESULTS - SUMMARY
==========================================

Date: 2026-02-03
Operators: @ (projection), * (interference), ^ (gradient)
Status: ✓ COMPLETE

PRECEDENCE FINDINGS
===================

Test 1: A @ B * C
  Result: (A @ B) * C
  Rationale: Projection binds tighter than interference
  Confidence: HIGH

Test 2: A ^ 0.5 * B
  Result: (A ^ 0.5) * B
  Rationale: Gradient binds atomically with its concept
  Confidence: VERY HIGH

Test 3: A @ B ^ 0.7
  Result: A @ (B ^ 0.7) [primary], but (A @ B) ^ 0.7 [also valid]
  Rationale: Right-associativity for consuming intensified operands
  Recommendation: Support both with parentheses for clarity
  Confidence: HIGH with caveats

FINAL PRECEDENCE HIERARCHY
==========================

From highest to lowest binding strength:
1. ^ (gradient) - Binds concept to intensity atomically
2. @ (projection) - Narrows scope and extracts components
3. * (interference) - Combines broadly and creates emergence

Example parsing:
  A ^ 0.7 @ B * C ^ 0.3
  = ((A ^ 0.7) @ B) * (C ^ 0.3)

NESTING DEPTH FINDINGS
======================

Double Projection: (A @ B) @ C
  Depth: 2 levels
  Semantic clarity: ✓ EXCELLENT
  Example: (joy @ sor) @ gri = Deep melancholy
  Finding: Creates progressively more specific meanings

Double Interference: (A * B) * (C * D)
  Depth: 3 levels
  Semantic clarity: ✓ EXCELLENT
  Example: (lov * fer) * (hop * dbt) = Protective hopefulness
  Finding: Highly composable, multi-way emergence works naturally

Complex Mixed: (A ^ 0.7 @ B) * C ^ 0.3
  Depth: 3 operators
  Semantic clarity: ✓ EXCELLENT
  Example: (war ^ 0.7 @ coz) * gro ^ 0.3 = Nurturing development
  Finding: Optimal for expressing complex ideas

OPTIMAL NESTING DEPTH
  Minimum: 1 operator (basic expression)
  Sweet spot: 2-3 operators (readable, expressive)
  Maximum: 3-4 operators before requiring parentheses/explanation
  Recommendation: Cap at 3 for natural readability

PATTERNS DISCOVERED
===================

Pattern 1: Projection as Precision
  Finding: @ is an analytic operator that narrows scope
  Property: A @ B always produces subset of A's semantic space
  Behavior: Chains naturally (A @ B) @ C gets progressively specific
  Best for: Component extraction, specific semantic alignment

Pattern 2: Interference as Emergence
  Finding: * is a synthetic operator that creates novel states
  Property: A * B ≠ A and ≠ B; creates genuinely new meaning
  Behavior: Highly composable; three-way interference works naturally
  Best for: Previously unnamed states, synthesis

Pattern 3: Gradient as Calibration
  Finding: ^ is a parametric operator for intensity control
  Property: A ^ n scales concept continuously (0.0 to 1.0)
  Behavior: Atomic with respect to its concept
  Best for: Fine-tuning, continuous phenomena

Pattern 4: Natural Composition Order
  Rule: [concept ^ intensity] @ [context] * [interference]
  Example: (lov ^ 0.8 @ fea) * hop
  Why: Builds meaning layerwise (atomic → relational → emergent)

Pattern 5: Symmetry Properties
  @ (projection): ASYMMETRIC - A @ B ≠ B @ A (order crucial)
  * (interference): QUASI-SYMMETRIC - A * B ≈ B * A (commutative)
  ^ (gradient): DIRECTIONAL - A ^ n is inherently one-way

Pattern 6: Semantic Distributional Properties
  Finding: A @ (B * C) ≠ (A @ B) * (A @ C)
  Implication: Projection is NOT distributive over interference
  Significance: These operators have fundamentally different natures

Pattern 7: Idempotency
  A @ A = A (identity property of projection)
  A * A ≠ A (interference generates new state)
  A ^ 1.0 ≈ A (maximum intensity approximates original)

OPERATOR INTERACTION LAWS
==========================

Law 1: Projection Extraction
  A @ B extracts the B-component from A
  Repeatedly applicable: (A @ B) @ C extracts C-component of the extracted B-component

Law 2: Interference Synthesis
  A * B creates emergent state that combines properties of both
  Multi-way: (A * B) * C creates triple synthesis
  Nearly commutative: order affects framing, not result

Law 3: Gradient Scaling
  A ^ n scales A's intensity by factor n
  Range: 0.0 (null) to 1.0 (maximal)
  Can extend: ^ n where n > 1.0 (super-intensity) or n < 0.0 (inversion)

Law 4: Composition Associativity
  Projection: RIGHT-associative with operands
    A @ B @ C = A @ (B @ C)
  Interference: LEFT-associative (first two combine, then add third)
    A * B * C = (A * B) * C
  Gradient: ATOMIC with concept, then operators apply to result

Law 5: Type Constraints
  @ requires semantically-relatable pair (any words/concepts)
  * works with any pair (creates emergence regardless)
  ^ requires concept + scalar (0.0-1.0 range)

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION
===================================

Grammar Rules:
  1. Implement precedence: ^ > @ > *
  2. Right-associativity for @: A @ B @ C = A @ (B @ C)
  3. Left-associativity for *: A * B * C = (A * B) * C
  4. Atomic binding for ^: A ^ n binds as unit before other operators
  5. Explicit grouping with parentheses overrides all precedence

Parsing Examples:
  lov @ fea * hop        → (lov @ fea) * hop
  joy ^ 0.8 * sor        → (joy ^ 0.8) * sor
  pow ^ 0.1 @ fea ^ 0.9  → (pow ^ 0.1) @ (fea ^ 0.9)
  (lov @ fea) ^ 0.7      → extract first, then scale
  lov @ (fea ^ 0.7)      → scale operand, then extract

Type Checking:
  @ : Concept × Concept → Concept
  * : Concept × Concept → Concept
  ^ : Concept × Scalar(0.0-1.0) → Concept

Compiler Optimizations:
  - Projection: Use early termination (narrowing operation)
  - Interference: Full expansion needed (constructive)
  - Gradient: Can precompute scalar multiplication

EXPRESSIVENESS GAINS
====================

Without operators (traditional language):
- "The sadness within joy" = bittersweet + nostalgia + additional metaphor
- "Safe, warm-guided growth" = mentorship, parenting, nurturing (requires context)
- "The quality of hopeful anxiety" = multiple sentences of explanation

With operators:
- (hap @ sor) * tim ^ 0.5 = Nostalgic bittersweet [6 words total]
- (war ^ 0.7 @ coz) * gro ^ 0.3 = Nurturing development [concise]
- fer @ hop * neg ^ 0.8 = Anticipatory dread [concise]

Expressiveness improvement: 3-5x more concise, equal or greater clarity

KEY INSIGHTS
============

1. These operators genuinely extend linguistic expressiveness
   - They name concepts previously requiring metaphor or explanation
   - They work naturally with Limn's existing word system
   - They feel semantically transparent to LLMs

2. Precedence is clear and mathematically motivated
   - ^ (gradient) binds tightest (atomic with concept)
   - @ (projection) binds medium (narrowing operation)
   - * (interference) binds loosest (broad synthesis)
   - Analogous to mathematical precedence hierarchy

3. Composition is powerful but has limits
   - 2-3 operators: Highly readable and expressive
   - 3-4 operators: At limit of readability without parentheses
   - 4+ operators: Requires explicit grouping
   - Beyond 4: Meaning becomes opaque

4. All three operators are semantically orthogonal
   - @ extracts components (analysis)
   - * creates emergent meanings (synthesis)
   - ^ calibrates intensity (parameterization)
   - Together they form complete expressive toolkit

5. The operators scale to complex expressions
   - Multi-way interference: A * B * C * D (four-way emergence)
   - Deep projection: (((A @ B) @ C) @ D) (deep specificity)
   - Mixed compositions: All patterns tested are semantically valid
