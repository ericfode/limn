# Limn for Beginners

*A cheatsheet by Kira the Student*

## What is Limn?

Limn is a language where **words are constraints** that narrow down meaning. Combine words and their meanings **intersect** - the result is what all the words have in common.

**Example:**
```limn
sol aqu
```
- `sol` = solid (rock, ice, bone, metal...)
- `aqu` = water (ocean, rain, river, tears...)
- `sol aqu` = solid AND water = **ice, glacier, frozen pond**

## The 10 Words You Need First

| Word | Meaning | Think of... |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `sol` | solid | **sol**id, rock, ice |
| `liq` | liquid | **liq**uid, water |
| `hot` | hot | fire, passion |
| `col` | cold | **col**d, ice |
| `big` | big | large, huge |
| `sma` | small | **sma**ll, tiny |
| `gro` | grow | **gro**w, expand |
| `mov` | move | **mov**e, motion |
| `joy` | joy | happy, delight |
| `sad` | sad | grief, sorrow |

## Three Rules

### Rule 1: Words Intersect

Adjacent words combine by AND. The meaning is what they share.

```limn
hot aqu        # hot water (tea, bath, steam)
col aqu        # cold water (ice, winter drink)
big aqu flo    # big water flowing (river, flood)
```

### Rule 2: Order Doesn't Matter

You can write words in any order. Same meaning.

```limn
sol aqu = aqu sol      # both mean ice
hot big = big hot      # both mean large and hot
```

### Rule 3: Operators Bind Right

Special words like `nu` (not) only affect the word right after them.

```limn
nu sol aqu    # NOT-solid water = liquid water
sol nu aqu    # solid NOT-water = dry solid (rock, bone)
```

---

## Key Operators

| Op | Meaning | Example |
|----|---------|---------|
| `nu` | not | `nu hot` = not hot = cold |
| `ve` | very | `ve hot` = very hot = scorching |
| `so` | somewhat | `so hot` = somewhat hot = warm |
| `→` | then | `hot → col` = hot then cold = cooling |
| `\|` | beside | `sol \| liq` = solid beside liquid |

---

## Common Patterns

### States (what something IS)
```limn
bri lux        # bright light (sunshine)
col aqu sol    # cold water solid (ice cube)
you lif gro    # young life growing (child, seedling)
```

### Changes (what HAPPENS)
```limn
sol → liq      # solid then liquid (melting)
hot → col      # hot then cold (cooling)
sad → hop → joy   # sad then hope then joy (recovery)
```

### Journeys (X → Y → X)
```limn
yo → an → yo   # here → there → here (travel and return)
kno → nu kno → kno   # know → not-know → know (learning)
lif → dea → lif     # life → death → life (rebirth)
```

## Gotchas

### Gotcha 1: Collisions

Some words have two meanings. Context helps.

| Word | Meaning 1 | Meaning 2 |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| `thi` | thin | think |
| `sho` | short | show |
| `blo` | block | blood |

### Gotcha 2: States vs Narratives

Without `→`, contradictions become paradoxes:
```limn
hot col        # hot AND cold = lukewarm? liminal?
```

With `→`, contradictions become stories:
```limn
hot → col      # hot THEN cold = cooling process
```

### Gotcha 3: Operator Stacking

Order matters!
```limn
nu ve hot      # NOT(very-hot) = not scorching, maybe warm
ve nu hot      # very(NOT-hot) = freezing cold
```

## Try It Yourself

### Exercise 1: Guess the meaning

```limn
aqu flo
lux bri
you lif
```

<details>
<summary>Answers</summary>

- `aqu flo` = water flowing = river, stream
- `lux bri` = light bright = sunshine, lamp
- `you lif` = young life = child, puppy, seedling

</details>

### Exercise 2: Write in Limn

1. A sunset (light ending)
2. Ice melting (solid water becoming liquid)
3. Growing old (young then old)

<details>
<summary>Possible Answers</summary>

1. `lux end` or `daw → dus` or `bri → dim`
2. `sol aqu → liq aqu` or `sol aqu tra liq`
3. `you → old` or `you gro → old`

</details>
