## Recommendations

### Critical (FAIL items — require action)

1. **cry/crys collision**: Remove `cry` or redefine. `crys` already covers crystallization. If physical crystal is needed, `crys` should be clarified to cover both, or `cry` should be reassigned to its natural English meaning (weeping/crying) and moved to an emotional domain.

2. **odd domain mismatch**: Move `odd` to Abstract or Mind & Cognition domain, or remove from Physical World entirely.

3. **bet/btw duplicate**: Choose one. Recommendation: keep `bet` (natural truncation of "between") and either remove `btw` or reassign it to a different meaning. `btw` follows internet abbreviation conventions rather than Limn's English truncation pattern.

### Systemic patterns worth addressing

- **Action words in Physical World**: `apr`, `arv`, `joi`, `lie` are actions/events, not physical properties or materials. Consider whether Physical World should include actions, or move these to an Actions domain.
- **Motion words in Space & Position**: `fli`, `rol`, `sli` are motions, not positions or shapes. The domain name "Space & Position" suggests static spatial relationships, not dynamic actions.
- **Abbreviation ambiguity cluster**: `con`, `ele`, `exp`, `imp`, `pre`, `res` are all common abbreviation roots with many English expansions. A reader unfamiliar with Limn might guess any of several meanings. This may be acceptable if context disambiguates, but it's a pattern worth monitoring.
- **Triple-overlap "inside" words**: `in`, `ins`, `wit` all mean inside/within. Consider consolidating to one or two with clear semantic differentiation (e.g., `in` = general, `wit` = contained-by relationship, retire `ins`).
