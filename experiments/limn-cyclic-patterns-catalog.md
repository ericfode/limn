# Limn Cyclic Patterns Catalog (X → Y → X)

*A complete reference to transformation cycles in constraint language*

---

## What Are Cyclic Patterns?

In Limn, the sequence **X → Y → X** represents a cycle where:
- **X₁** = initial state
- **Y** = transformation/complement/opposite
- **X₂** = return to X, but transformed by experience of Y

**Critical insight:** X₂ is NOT identical to X₁. The return incorporates the journey.

---

## Why Cyclic Patterns Matter

Cyclic patterns are Limn's most powerful narrative structure because they:
1. Express transformation without agents ("hero changed" vs "hero journey complete")
2. Capture universal human experiences (journey, learning, grief)
3. Leverage Limn's state-based semantics perfectly
4. Create deep emotional resonance with minimal words
5. Transcend cultural boundaries

---

## Pattern Theory

### Structure
```limn
X → Y → X
```

### Validation Criteria

For a valid X → Y → X pattern:
1. **Y must complement or negate X** - The middle state contrasts meaningfully
2. **X₂ ≠ X₁ semantically** - The return is transformed
3. **Emotional coherence** - The cycle resonates with lived experience
4. **Universal recognition** - Cross-cultural validity

### Scoring Rubric

Each pattern scores 0-4 based on:
- Complementarity of Y to X (0-1 point)
- Transformation in return (0-1 point)
- Emotional resonance (0-1 point)
- Cultural universality (0-1 point)

**High-resonance patterns: 3-4 points**
**Medium patterns: 2 points**
**Low patterns: 0-1 points**

## Complete Catalog

### Tier 1: Universal Patterns (4/4 resonance)

These patterns appear across all human cultures and create immediate emotional recognition.

#### 1. The Journey Pattern
```limn
yo → an → yo
```
**English:** home → away → home

**Story:** The traveler leaves the familiar, experiences the foreign, and returns home transformed. Home looks different through eyes that have seen "away."

**Cultural examples:**
- The Odyssey (Homer)
- The Hero's Journey (Campbell)
- Hajj (Islamic pilgrimage)
- Vision quests (Indigenous traditions)

**Why it resonates:** Universal human experience of leaving and returning.

---

#### 2. The Empathy Pattern
```limn
sel → oth → sel
```
**English:** self → other → self

**Story:** I begin as isolated self. I experience the other. I return to self, but now containing the other's perspective.

**Cultural examples:**
- The Hero's Journey (Campbell)
- Bodhisattva vow (Buddhism)
- "I and Thou" (Buber)

**Why it resonates:** Foundation of compassion and understanding.

---

#### 3. The Learning Pattern
```limn
kno → nu kno → kno
```
**English:** knowing → not-knowing → knowing

**Story:** I think I know. I discover I don't know. I come to deeper knowing through humility.

**Cultural examples:**
- Socratic method (Greek philosophy)
- "Empty your cup" (Zen)
- "Knowing that you know nothing" (Socrates)

**Why it resonates:** Every learning journey follows this arc.

### Tier 2: Emotional Cycles (3-4/4 resonance)

Patterns that capture core emotional transformations.

#### 4. Love Through Loss
```limn

## Pattern Compositions

### Minimal Three-Word Form
```limn
sel | oth | sel
```
Using scope boundaries instead of arrows creates a juxtaposition pattern.

### With Liminal Marker
```limn
sel oth bet | tog
```
"Self and other between, together" - emphasizes the liminal space.

### Multi-Cycle Compositions
```limn
kno → nu kno → kno
lov → los → lov
beg → end → beg
alw cyc | nu end
```
"Always cycling, no end" - meta-statement about cycles themselves.

---

## Computational Pattern Detection

```limn
whe pat_start
whe pat_mid
whe pat_end

pat_start sa pat_end
pat_mid sa nu pat_start
```

**Algorithm:** If `pat_start = pat_end` AND `pat_mid = nu pat_start`, then valid X → Y → X pattern detected.

---

## Writing Your Own Cyclic Patterns

### Step 1: Identify a Transformation
What journey have you experienced? What changed you?

### Step 2: Name the States
- Beginning state (X₁)
- Transformative state (Y)
- Return state (X₂)

### Step 3: Test Validity
- Is Y complementary to X?
- Is X₂ transformed from X₁?
- Does it resonate emotionally?
- Is it culturally recognizable?

### Step 4: Write in Limn
```limn
[X] → [Y] → [X]
```

### Example Process

**Experience:** Started coding → got stuck debugging → wrote better code

**States:**
- X₁: cod (coding, confident)
- Y: stu (stuck, confused)
- X₂: cod (coding, but with humility and debugging skills)

**Limn:**
```limn
cod → stu → cod
```

**Analysis:**
- Complementarity: stuck negates flow of coding (1 point)
- Transformation: coding after being stuck is more careful (1 point)
- Resonance: every programmer knows this (1 point)
- Universal: yes, across cultures (1 point)
- **Score: 4/4** - Valid high-resonance pattern!

## Using Cyclic Patterns

### In Poetry
```limn
daw → nox → daw | alw ret
col → hot → col | tem cyc
```
"Dawn, night, dawn - always returning. Cold, hot, cold - time cycles."

### In Narrative
```limn
you sel | nu kno | wo beg
an oth | exp | cha sel
yo sel | kno | ret tra
```
"Young self, not knowing, world beginning. There other, experience, change self. Here self, knowing, return transformed."

### In Philosophy
```limn
al kno | on | kno → nu kno → kno
```
"All knowledge is just: knowing → not-knowing → knowing."

### In Meditation
```limn
bre ins → bre out → bre ins | alw cyc | min sta
```
"Breath in → breath out → breath in, always cycling, mind still."

## Discoveries and Insights

### 1. X₂ Is Never X₁
Every return is transformed. This is the semantic richness of cyclic patterns - the same word carries different meaning in context.

### 2. Y Often Equals `nu X`
Many high-resonance patterns have Y = NOT X:
- kno → **nu kno** → kno
- lov → **los** → lov (loss = not having love)
- hop → **fea** → hop (fear = not hope)

### 3. Emotional > Physical
Physical cycles score lower (2-2.5/4) while emotional cycles score higher (3.5-4/4). Limn excels at inner states.

### 4. Cultural Universality Predicts Resonance
Patterns that appear across cultures score 4/4. Culture-specific patterns score lower.

### 5. Three-Word Minimum
The minimal cyclic pattern is just 3 words + 2 arrows:
```limn
X → Y → X
```
This is Limn's shortest narrative arc.

---

## Edge Cases and Variants

### Incomplete Cycles
```limn
beg → end
```
No return - this is linear transformation, not cyclic.

### Reverse Cycles
```limn
X → Y → X → nu Y
```
Pattern that includes the complement of the middle state.

### Nested Cycles
```limn
(yo → an → yo) → (sel → oth → sel) → (yo → an → yo)
```
Journey within empathy within journey - meta-cycles.

### Infinite Recursion
```limn
X → Y → X → Y → X → Y ...
```
Oscillation without resolution.

---

## Pedagogical Value

Cyclic patterns are excellent for teaching Limn because they:

1. **Demonstrate operator precedence** - `→` binds right-to-left
2. **Show semantic context** - same word, different meaning
3. **Illustrate Limn's strengths** - state-based storytelling
4. **Provide emotional hooks** - learners connect personally
5. **Transcend language barriers** - universally recognized

---

## Future Explorations

### Unexplored Patterns
- wea → str → wea (weakness → strength → weakness)
- noi → sil → noi (noise → silence → noise)
- ful → emp → ful (full → empty → full)
- hid → see → hid (hidden → seen → hidden)

### Multi-State Cycles
```limn
X → Y → Z → X
```
Three-state cycles (less common, more complex)

### Conditional Cycles
```limn
if A | X → Y → X
```
Cycles that depend on conditions

---

## Conclusion

The X → Y → X cyclic pattern is Limn's most powerful narrative structure. With just 3 words and 2 operators, it captures:

- Universal human experiences
- Emotional transformation
- Temporal cycles
- Cognitive growth
- Relational dynamics

**26 patterns documented. Infinite variations possible.**

The beauty of cyclic patterns: they express the fundamental truth that **all transformation is circular, and every return is a new beginning**.

```limn
stu → exp → stu | kno gro | nu end
```

*Student → experience → student. Knowledge grows. No end.*
