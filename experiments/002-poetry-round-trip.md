# Experiment 002: Poetry Round-Trip Translation

**Hypothesis:** Poetry stresses language boundaries. If Limn can carry poetic meaning across languages, its universality claim strengthens.

**Method:** Classic poems from non-Indo-European languages → Limn → Back-translation to English and original language.

## Test 1: Bashō Haiku - "Old Pond"

### Original (Japanese)
```
古池や
蛙飛びこむ
水の音

furu ike ya
kawazu tobikomu
mizu no oto
```

### Literal English
```
Old pond —
frog jumps in —
water's sound
```

### Analysis
What makes this work:
- **Juxtaposition** (切れ字 kireji): The や (ya) creates a pause
- **Temporal flow**: stillness → event → aftermath
- **Negative space**: The silence before and after
- **Mono no aware**: Awareness of transience

### Limn Translation Attempt 1: Direct
```
old aqu | ani fal ins | aud
```
- `old aqu` = old water (pond)
- `ani fal ins` = animal falls inside (frog jumps in)
- `aud` = sound

### Limn Translation Attempt 2: With Temporal Markers
```
old aqu res | fis fal ins | aud wav
```
- `old aqu res` = old water resting (stillness)
- `fis fal ins` = fish falls inside (closer to "jumps")
- `aud wav` = sound wave

Wait - `fis` is fish, not frog. Limn has no frog. Let me check vocabulary...

No amphibian category. I can use:
- `ani` (animal) - too generic
- `sma ani wet` (small animal wet) - compositional but clunky

### Limn Translation Attempt 3: Compositional Frog
```
old aqu res | sma ani wet fal ins | aud wav eme
```
- `old aqu res` = old water, stillness
- `sma ani wet fal ins` = small wet animal falls inside
- `aud wav eme` = sound wave emerges

### Limn Translation Attempt 4: With Sequence Operator
```
res → fal → aud
old aqu | sma ani wet
```
- `res → fal → aud` = rest → fall → sound (the temporal flow)
- `old aqu` = old water (context)
- `sma ani wet` = small wet animal (frog)

### Back-translation (English)
"In old water: stillness, then falling, then sound. Small wet animal."

### Back-translation (Japanese)
"古い水の中: 静けさ、落下、音。小さな濡れた動物。"

### Fidelity: 35%
### Lost:
- The 切れ字 (kireji) pause - the や
- The *sound* of the Japanese - the rhythm, the phonaesthetic beauty
- The季語 (kigo) seasonal reference (frogs = spring)
- The Zen aesthetic - the poem is not *about* the frog, it's about *awareness*
- The negative space - what's NOT said

### Gained:
- The sequence operator `→` captures temporal flow well
- Compositional description is accurate

### Problem Identified:
**Limn lacks a vocabulary for poetic *form*** - caesuras, line breaks, rhythm, sound patterns. It can describe *content* but not *structure*.

## Test 2: Rumi - من‎ (Man/I)

### Original (Persian/Farsi)
```
من زمانی نه چنان بودم که هست
من زمان هستم که نیستی، من هست
```

Romanization:
```
man zamāni na chenān budam ke hast
man zamān hastam ke nisti, man hast
```

### Literal English
```
I was not once what I am now
I am the time that is not-being; I am being
```

### Analysis
- **Wordplay**: هست (hast = being) and نیست (nist = non-being)
- **Paradox**: "I am the time that is not-being"
- **Sufi mysticism**: Identity dissolution, becoming one with the divine
- **Persian poetic form**: This is a bayt (couplet) in مثنوی (mathnawi) meter

### Limn Attempt 1: Direct
```
sel pas nu sel now
sel tim sa nu lif | sel sa lif
```
- `sel pas nu sel now` = self past not self now (I was not what I am)
- `sel tim sa nu lif | sel sa lif` = self time equals not-life, self equals life

### Limn Attempt 2: Richer
```
sel pas tra sel now | nu sam
sel tim bet | nu lif sa lif
```
- `sel pas tra sel now | nu sam` = self past transform self now, not same
- `sel tim bet | nu lif sa lif` = self time between, non-life equals life (paradox preserved!)

### Back-translation (English)
"Self transforms from past to now; not the same.
Self exists between time; non-being equals being."

### Back-translation (Persian)
"خود از گذشته به حال تغییر می‌کند؛ یکسان نیست.
خود بین زمان وجود دارد؛ نبود برابر با بود است."

### Fidelity: 60%
### Lost:
- The meter and rhyme (hast/hast)
- The Persian wordplay on هست/نیست
- The Sufi context - this isn't just philosophy, it's spiritual practice
- The beauty of the Persian language itself

### Gained:
- The paradox `nu lif sa lif` (non-life equals life) works!
- Limn can express contradictions effectively
- The `bet` (between) captures liminality well

### Notes:
Limn handles **philosophical paradox** better than **aesthetic experience**. Rumi's meaning survives, but the *poetry* doesn't.

## Test 3: Li Bai (李白) - "Quiet Night Thought"

### Original (Classical Chinese)
```
床前明月光
疑是地上霜
举头望明月
低头思故乡
```

### Pinyin
```
chuáng qián míng yuè guāng
yí shì dì shàng shuāng
jǔ tóu wàng míng yuè
dī tóu sī gù xiāng
```

### Literal English
```
Bright moonlight before my bed
I suspect it is frost on the ground
Raise head, gaze at bright moon
Lower head, think of old hometown
```

### Analysis
- **5-character regulated verse** (五言絕句): Strict tonal patterns
- **Parallelism**: Lines 3-4 mirror each other structurally
- **Imagery**: Moon → frost → homesickness
- **Classical Chinese compression**: No grammar particles, pure imagery

### Limn Attempt 1: Line-by-line
```
# Line 1: Bright moonlight before bed
lux bri mou nea res | sil

# Line 2: Seems like frost on ground
sim fre ter

# Line 3: Raise head, see bright moon
hed ris | see lux sil

# Line 4: Lower head, remember home
hed fal | rem fam hom
```

Combined:
```
lux bri sil nea res | sim fre ter
hed ris see sil | hed fal rem hom
```

### Limn Attempt 2: Compressed (More Like Classical Chinese)
```
sil lux res | sim fre
hed ris see | hed fal rem hom
```
- `sil lux res` = silver light, stillness (moonlight, night)
- `sim fre` = seems frozen (frost)
- `hed ris see | hed fal rem hom` = head rises seeing, head falls remembering home

### Back-translation (English)
"Silver light, stillness. Seems frozen.
Head rises, seeing. Head falls, remembering home."

### Back-translation (Mandarin)
"銀色的光，靜止。似乎冰凍。
頭抬起，看見。頭低下，記得家。"

### Fidelity: 50%
### Lost:
- The 5-7-5 tonal pattern
- The parallelism (舉/低, 望/思 - raise/lower, gaze/think)
- The specific imagery chain: moonlight → frost → moon → home (the *logic* of the imagery)
- The compressed elegance of Classical Chinese
- 鄉愁 (xiāngchóu) - homesickness, nostalgia - a complex emotion reduced to `rem hom`

### Gained:
- The `hed ris... hed fal...` parallelism is preserved!
- Temporal sequence works
- Core imagery survives

### Notes:
Classical Chinese achieves **maximum meaning in minimum form**. Limn's compositionality fights against this. Where 床前明月光 (5 characters) evokes an entire scene, `lux bri sil nea res` (5 words) feels mechanical.

## Test 4: Yoruba Oriki (Praise Poetry)

### Original (Yoruba)
```
Ìyá mi, ìyá mi
Obìnrin tó ní ọkàn funfun
Àgbà tó gbón
Òkè tó ga ju òkè lọ
```

### English Translation
```
My mother, my mother
Woman with a white/pure heart
Elder who is wise
Mountain taller than mountains
```

### Analysis
- **Oriki** = praise poetry, genealogy, identity
- **Metaphor stacking**: Each line adds another layer of praise
- **Tonal language**: Yoruba has 3 tones; meaning changes with tone
- **Call-and-response structure**: This would be performed, not just read
- **Cultural context**: Oriki establishes identity, lineage, power

### Limn Attempt 1
```
par sel | sel sel
oth hum | hrt cle whi
old | kno ve
big ve | abo all big
```
- `par sel | sel sel` = parent self, self self (mother mine, emphasis)
- `oth hum | hrt cle whi` = other human, heart clear white (woman, pure heart)
- `old | kno ve` = old, very knowing (wise elder)
- `big ve | abo all big` = very big, above all big (tallest mountain)

### Limn Attempt 2: With More Respect
```
par hum | sel
hum hrt whi cle
old kno ve
ter big abo ter all
```
- `par hum | sel` = parent human, mine
- `hum hrt whi cle` = human heart white clear
- `old kno ve` = old very knowing
- `ter big abo ter all` = earth-big (mountain) above earth-big all

### Back-translation (English)
"Parent human, mine.
Human with white-clear heart.
Old, very knowing.
Mountain above all mountains."

### Back-translation (Yoruba - hypothetical)
"Òbí ènìyàn, tèmi.
Ènìyàn tí ó ní ọkàn funfun tó mọ́.
Àgbà tó mọ̀ púpọ̀.
Òkè tó ga ju gbogbo òkè lọ."

### Fidelity: 30%
### Lost:
- **The repetition** (`ìyá mi, ìyá mi`) - lost the emotional emphasis
- **The tonal music** - Yoruba *sounds* like praise
- **The performance aspect** - Oriki is embodied, ritualized speech
- **Cultural weight** - This isn't just description, it's *invocation*
- **The personal/communal nature** - Oriki connects individual to lineage

### Gained:
- Semantic content is mostly there
- Metaphors survive somewhat

### Critical Problem:
**Limn cannot encode *tone* of voice** (reverence, celebration, authority). The *what* is there, but the *how* is gone.

## Test 5: Quechua Song - "Valicha"

### Original (Quechua)
```
Valicha valicha
Wayta sipascha
Urpi hina
Rikch'arispa
```

### Literal Translation
```
Valicha, Valicha (girl's name)
Flower maiden
Like a dove
You appear
```

### Analysis
- **Andean love song**: Emotional, tender
- **Natural metaphors**: Flower (wayta), dove (urpi) - Andean imagery
- **Agglutination**: Quechua builds meaning through suffixes
  - `sipas-cha` = maiden-diminutive/affectionate
  - `rikch'ari-spa` = appear-gerund
- **Music inseparable from words**: This is sung, not spoken

### Limn Attempt
```
nam sel | you hum
veg bea | sim avi
eme you
```
- `nam sel` = name-self (Valicha - name reference)
- `you hum` = young human (maiden)
- `veg bea | sim avi` = vegetation beautiful, like bird (flower, like dove)
- `eme you` = emerge young (you appear)

### Back-translation (English)
"Named one, young human.
Beautiful plant, like bird.
Young emerging."

### Fidelity: 25%
### Lost:
- **The name itself** - "Valicha" carries cultural/personal weight
- **Diminutives and affection** - Quechua's -cha suffix = tenderness
- **Andean natural world** - `veg` is generic; wayta is specifically Andean flora
- **The melody** - inseparable from meaning
- **Cultural context** - This is Andean courtship, identity, place

### Problem Identified:
**Limn has no diminutives, no affection markers, no way to encode emotional tone** beyond emotion words (`lov`, `joy`, etc.). The *feeling* of language is absent.

---

## Cross-Cutting Observations

### What Limn Can Do:
1. **Semantic content**: Core meanings survive
2. **Paradox and philosophy**: Logical contradictions work well (`nu lif sa lif`)
3. **Temporal sequence**: The `→` operator preserves causality
4. **Metaphor**: Intersections create metaphorical meaning

### What Limn Cannot Do:
1. **Form**: No meter, rhythm, rhyme, line breaks
2. **Sound**: No phonaesthetics, tonal languages cannot map
3. **Affect**: No diminutives, honorifics, emotional registers
4. **Cultural specificity**: Words carry history; Limn is ahistorical
5. **Performance**: Poetry is embodied; Limn is disembodied text
6. **Negative space**: Poetry is what's *not* said; Limn is explicit

### The "Universal" Claim:
Limn can express **propositional content** across languages.
Limn cannot carry **poetic form, affect, cultural weight, or sonic beauty**.

Poetry is not content. Poetry is form *and* content indivisible. Limn can translate one but not the other.

---

## Recommendation:

If Limn aims for universality, it needs:
1. **Affective markers**: Diminutives, honorifics, emotional register
2. **Prosodic notation**: Some way to encode rhythm, pause, emphasis
3. **Cultural context keys**: Metadata about cultural origins
4. **Sound-symbolic vocabulary**: Words that *sound* like their meaning across language families

Otherwise, Limn is a *philosophical* language, not a *poetic* one.
