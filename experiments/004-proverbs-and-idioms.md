# Experiment 004: Proverbs and Idioms Across Cultures

**Hypothesis:** Cultural wisdom encoded in proverbs will reveal vocabulary gaps and English-centric biases in Limn.

**Method:** Translate proverbs from diverse language families to Limn, assess fidelity, identify missing concepts.

---

## Test Case 1: Chinese (Mandarin)

### Original
**塞翁失马，焉知非福**
(sài wēng shī mǎ, yān zhī fēi fú)

**Literal:** "The old frontier guard lost his horse; how do we know it's not a blessing?"

**Cultural meaning:** A seeming misfortune may turn out to be a blessing. Events should not be judged immediately.

### Limn Translation
```limn
old man los equ; who kno if bad ore gud?
```

**Word by word:**
- old man = old human male
- los = lose (lose)
- equ = horse
- who = who
- kno = know
- if = if
- bad = bad
- ore = or
- gud = good

### Back-translation
"An old man lost a horse; who knows if bad or good?"

### Fidelity: 70%

**Preserved:**
- Core narrative (old man, horse, loss)
- Uncertainty principle (who knows)
- Bad/good ambiguity

**Lost:**
- Cultural context (frontier guard during warring states)
- Philosophical depth (Daoist acceptance of change)
- Proverbial tone/authority

**Vocabulary Gaps:**
- No term for "blessing" (religious/spiritual favor)
- No term for "fortune" (luck, fate)
- No "frontier/border" concept
- Missing philosophical modality (things transform over time)

## Test Case 2: Arabic

### Original
**الصبر مفتاح الفرج**
(aṣ-ṣabr miftāḥ al-faraj)

**Literal:** "Patience is the key to relief"

**Cultural meaning:** Perseverance through hardship brings eventual resolution. Strong Islamic cultural value.

### Limn Translation
```limn
tim wai is way to end sad
```

**Word by word:**
- tim wai = time + wait (patience)
- is = is
- way = path/method
- to = to
- end = finish
- sad = sadness/suffering

### Back-translation
"Waiting over time is the way to end sadness"

### Fidelity: 55%

**Preserved:**
- Core concept (patience)
- Result (relief from suffering)
- Causal relationship

**Lost:**
- "Key" metaphor (instrumental means)
- "Relief" (specific kind of release from hardship)
- Islamic cultural framing
- Proverbial authority

**Vocabulary Gaps:**
- No word for "patience" (need compound: tim wai)
- No "relief/release" (faraj - specific freedom from distress)
- No "key" (tool metaphor)
- Missing virtue terminology (patience as moral quality)

## Test Case 3: Yoruba (Niger-Congo)

### Original
**Ọwọ́ ọ̀tún ná ọwọ́ òsì, ọwọ́ òsì ná ọwọ́ ọ̀tún**
(owo otun na owo osi, owo osi na owo otun)

**Literal:** "The right hand washes the left hand, the left hand washes the right hand"

**Cultural meaning:** Mutual cooperation and reciprocity. Community interdependence.

### Limn Translation
```limn
rit han cle lef han, lef han cle rit han
```

**Word by word:**
- rit = right
- han = hand
- cle = clean
- lef = left

### Back-translation
"Right hand cleans left hand, left hand cleans right hand"

### Fidelity: 85%

**Preserved:**
- Complete structure (parallel phrases)
- Body metaphor (hands)
- Reciprocity concept
- Symmetry

**Lost:**
- "Wash" vs "clean" (specific action)
- Cultural resonance (Ubuntu-like communalism)
- Proverbial register

**Vocabulary Gaps:**
- Need "wash" distinct from "clean"
- Missing community/reciprocity vocabulary
- No terms for mutual aid concepts

**Note:** This proverb translates WELL because it's based on physical action, not abstract cultural concepts.

## Test Case 4: Swahili (Bantu)

### Original
**Haraka haraka haina baraka**

**Literal:** "Hurry hurry has no blessing"

**Cultural meaning:** Rushing leads to poor outcomes. Patience and care produce better results.

### Limn Translation
```limn
fas fas mak bad end
```

**Word by word:**
- fas = fast
- mak = make
- bad = bad
- end = result

### Back-translation
"Fast fast makes bad results"

### Fidelity: 50%

**Preserved:**
- Speed concept (repetition for emphasis)
- Negative outcome

**Lost:**
- "Blessing" (baraka - spiritual favor)
- Why rushing is bad (no care/patience)
- Cultural Islamic context (baraka is Arabic loanword)

**Vocabulary Gaps:**

### Original
**Тише едешь — дальше будешь**
(Tishe yedesh' — dal'she budesh')

**Literal:** "The quieter you go, the farther you'll get"

### Limn Translation
```limn
slo mov mak lon end
```

**Word by word:**
- slo = slow
- mov = move
- mak = make

- end = result/distance

### Back-translation
"Slow movement makes long results"

### Fidelity: 60%

**Preserved:**
- Slow motion concept
- Better outcome (long/far)
- Causal link

**Lost:**
- "Quiet" dimension (tishe = quieter, gentler)
- Future certainty ("will be")
- Comparative structure (quieter → farther)

**Vocabulary Gaps:**
- No "quiet" separate from "silent"
- No comparative morphology (-er)
- No future tense markers
- Missing gradation (more X → more Y)

## Test Case 6: Japanese

### Original
**出る杭は打たれる**
(deru kugi wa utareru)

**Literal:** "The nail that sticks out gets hammered down"

**Cultural meaning:** Conformity is valued; standing out invites criticism. Reflects collectivist values.

- get = get
- hit = hit
- dow = down

### Back-translation
"The part that rises gets hit down"

```limn
nu har is top gud act
```

**Word by word:**
- nu = not (negation)
- har = harm
- is = is
- top = highest
- gud = good
- act = action/behavior

### Back-translation
"Not harming is the highest good action"

### Fidelity: 40%

**Preserved:**
- Non-harm concept
- Superlative (highest)
- Moral valence (good)

**Lost:**
- "Dharma" (cosmic law, duty, righteousness - untranslatable!)
- Religious/philosophical authority

- Spiritual dimension

**Vocabulary Gaps:**
- No "dharma" (law/duty/righteousness/cosmic order)
- No "ahimsa" (principled non-violence)
- No religious/spiritual terminology
- Missing virtue/ethics domain
- No "supreme/ultimate" (qualitative superlative)

**Critical finding:** Religious/philosophical concepts are nearly untranslatable without extensive Limn vocabulary expansion.

### Original
**Ama suwa, ama llulla, ama qilla**

**Literal:** "Don't steal, don't lie, don't be lazy"

```limn
nu tak, nu fal, nu slo
```

- tak = take (steal)
- fal = false (lie)
- slo = slow (lazy)

### Back-translation
"Don't take, don't be false, don't be slow"

### Fidelity: 70%

**Preserved:**
- Three parallel prohibitions
- Core concepts (theft, dishonesty, laziness)
- Imperative mood

**Lost:**
- "Ama" repetition (structural emphasis)

## Proposed Vocabulary Additions

### High Priority (Spiritual/Moral)

```limn
ble     blessing, divine favor
dut     duty, obligation
vir     virtue, moral excellence
wis     wisdom (quality, not just knowledge)
pat     patience (virtue, not just waiting)
sac     sacred, holy
rit     ritual, ceremony
fai     faith, trust in divine
```

### Medium Priority (Cultural)

```limn
mut     mutual, reciprocal
com     community, collective
hon     honor, face, reputation
sha     share, distribute
bon     bond, connection
con     conform, fit in
```

### Tools & Metaphors

```limn
nai     nail (fastener)
ham     hammer (tool/action)
kei     key (opener, solution)
pat     path (way, method)
too     tool (instrument)
```

### Grammar Extensions

- Comparative: `mor X` (more X) or suffix `-er`
- Passive: `get + verb` (already works: "get hit")
- Proverbial marker: `wis` prefix? ("wisdom says...")

---

## English-Centric Biases Confirmed

1. **Individualism:** Limn has strong "I/you/me" but weak communal/collective terms
2. **Materialism:** Physical objects well-represented, spiritual concepts absent
3. **Secular:** No religious/sacred terminology
4. **Western philosophy:** Logic/science terms present, Eastern concepts missing
5. **Tool-using culture:** Generic "tool" exists but specific tools (nail, key) missing

---

## Recommendations

### For Cross-Linguistic Accessibility

1. **Add spiritual vocabulary** - At minimum: ble (blessing), sac (sacred), fai (faith)
2. **Expand moral terms** - Add virtue vocabulary: pat (patience), wis (wisdom as quality), hon (honor)
3. **Cultural concepts** - Add: mut (mutual), com (community), sha (share)
4. **Metaphorical tools** - Add common metaphor sources: kei (key), pat (path)

### For Future Testing

1. Test kinship terms across cultures (very language-dependent)
2. Test color vocabulary (known to vary)
3. Test spatial relations (varies by culture)
4. Test time/aspect concepts

---

## Conclusion

**Proverbs are harder to translate than poetry** (63% vs 25-60% in Experiment 002) because they encode deep cultural concepts and moral frameworks that Limn's vocabulary doesn't support.

The pattern is clear:
- **Physical metaphors translate well** (85% - Yoruba hands)
- **Cultural/spiritual concepts translate poorly** (40% - Sanskrit dharma, 50% - Swahili baraka)
- **Limn is English/Western-centric** in its conceptual inventory

**To become truly cross-linguistic, Limn needs:**
1. Spiritual/religious terminology
2. Virtue/ethics vocabulary
3. Cultural concepts (reciprocity, community, honor)
4. Richer metaphorical domains

**Without these additions, Limn remains culturally constrained to secular, individualist, Western thought patterns.**
