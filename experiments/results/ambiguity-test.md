## Summary Statistics

| Sentence | Without Key | With Key | Collapse Ratio |
|----------|-------------|----------|----------------|
| `ra vi du` | 12 | 3 | 4.00x |
| `ko su fi` | 11 | 3 | 3.67x |
| `mu na wo` | 13 | 4 | 3.25x |
| `ve lu ta` | 11 | 4 | 2.75x |
| `mi he vi` | 12 | 4 | 3.00x |

**Average Key Collapse Ratio:** 3.33x

---

## Analysis

The Key Collapse Ratio demonstrates that providing the context key "technology" reduces ambiguity by an average factor of 3.33x. This confirms the core Limn principle: meaning emerges from constraint intersection, and keys further narrow the semantic space.

**Observations:**
1. All sentences maintained 10+ interpretations without a key, confirming high ambiguity by design
2. Technology key consistently collapsed interpretations to 3-4 specific meanings
3. The collapse is not uniform - some sentences are more "technology-compatible" than others
4. Even with the key, multiple interpretations remain, allowing for nuanced expression

**AMBIGUITY TEST: PASS**
