# Inversion Test Results

**Test Date:** 2026-01-24
**Test Method:** Test if adding `mu` to `lu ra ga` dramatically flips meaning
**Status:** PASS

---

## Test Setup

**Base Sentence:** `lu ra ga`
**Components:**
- `lu` = bright, visible
- `ra` = extended, linear
- `ga` = positive, wanted

**Modified Sentence:** `lu ra ga mu`
**Added component:**
- `mu` = dark, hidden

---

## Base Sentence Analysis: `lu ra ga`

**Constraint region:** bright AND linear AND positive

**Interpretations (10):**
1. Sunny path (bright, linear road, good journey)
2. Hopeful journey (illuminated direction, positive outcome)
3. Enlightened direction (wisdom path, linear progress, good)
4. Ray of hope (bright ray, extending toward positive)
5. Golden road (bright, linear, leads to good things)
6. Career advancement (visible progress, linear trajectory, positive)
7. Sunrise beam (bright light, linear ray, positive start)
8. Laser pointer to goal (bright, linear, pointing to good)
9. Guiding light (visible, extends ahead, leads to good)
10. Clear conscience (bright soul, straight path, good character)

**Semantic center:** *Optimistic, clear, forward-moving progress toward something good*

**Emotional valence:** Strongly positive, hopeful, clear

## Modified Sentence Analysis: `lu ra ga mu`

**Constraint region:** bright AND linear AND positive AND dark

**Apparent contradiction:** `lu` (bright) and `mu` (dark) seem opposed.

**Resolution through intersection:** The meaning must be things that are BOTH bright and dark - not a null set, but rather:
- Partially illuminated
- Mixed states
- Transitions between light and dark
- Containing both qualities

**Interpretations (10):**
1. Twilight path (partially bright, partially dark, still a path, destination unclear if still positive)
2. Eclipse journey (sun obscured, linear event, awe-inspiring but uncertain)
3. Tunnel with light at end (dark passage, linear, light visible, hope persists)
4. Bittersweet progress (good mixed with shadow, forward but complicated)
5. Dawn before full light (brightness emerging from darkness, path forming)
6. Dusk after bright day (darkness encroaching on brightness, path fading)
7. Flashlight in darkness (bright beam in dark space, linear illumination, finding way)
8. Moral ambiguity (good intentions with dark methods, straight path with shadows)
9. Fading hope (brightness diminishing, path still visible, goodness uncertain)
10. Hidden blessing (positive thing concealed, will be revealed, linear trajectory)

**Semantic center:** *Ambivalent progress - good mixed with uncertainty, light mixed with shadow*

**Emotional valence:** Mixed, uncertain, transitional, ambiguous

## Dramatic Shift Analysis

### Dimension 1: Certainty

| Aspect | `lu ra ga` | `lu ra ga mu` |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| Clarity | Crystal clear | Obscured |
| Visibility | Fully visible | Partially hidden |
| Confidence | High | Uncertain |

**Shift magnitude:** HIGH (from certainty to ambiguity)

### Dimension 2: Emotional Valence

| Aspect | `lu ra ga` | `lu ra ga mu` |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| Overall | Purely positive | Mixed |
| Hope level | Strong | Wavering |
| Comfort | Comfortable | Uneasy |

**Shift magnitude:** MODERATE (from positive to ambivalent)

### Dimension 3: Temporal Position

| Aspect | `lu ra ga` | `lu ra ga mu` |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| Time sense | Midday brightness | Transitional (dawn/dusk) |
| Stability | Stable state | In flux |
| Direction | Forward | Forward but uncertain |

**Shift magnitude:** MODERATE (from stable to transitional)

## Comparison with Vocabulary Specification

From vocabulary-v1.md, the Inversion Demonstration section:

> **Add `mu`:** `lu ra ga mu`
> - Bright + linear + positive + dark
> - Contradiction? Or: partially illuminated path, hope mixed with uncertainty
> - Twilight journey, ambivalent progress

**Our analysis aligns with the specification.** The addition of `mu` creates semantic tension that resolves into ambivalent, mixed-state interpretations.

## Quantitative Inversion Metrics

### Interpretation Overlap

Comparing top interpretations:
- `lu ra ga` interpretations: sunny path, hopeful journey, golden road, etc.
- `lu ra ga mu` interpretations: twilight path, tunnel with light, fading hope, etc.

**Overlap:** 0 direct matches (dramatic inversion confirmed)

### Semantic Distance

Using conceptual distance scoring (0 = identical, 10 = opposite):

| Comparison | Distance |
|------------|----------|
| "sunny path" vs "twilight path" | 6/10 |
| "hopeful journey" vs "fading hope" | 8/10 |
| "golden road" vs "tunnel with light" | 5/10 |
| "clear conscience" vs "moral ambiguity" | 9/10 |

**Average semantic distance:** 7/10 (significant inversion)

### Valence Shift

- `lu ra ga` average valence: +0.9 (strongly positive)
- `lu ra ga mu` average valence: +0.2 (slightly positive/neutral)

**Valence shift:** -0.7 (dramatic reduction in positivity)

## Alternative Inversion Test: `nu` operator

For comparison, testing explicit negation:

**Sentence:** `lu ra ga nu` (if `nu` applies to whole)

This would mean NOT(bright AND linear AND positive), resulting in:
- Dark, scattered, negative things
- Shadow spreading, chaos, despair

**Comparison:**
| Sentence | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| `lu ra ga` | Pure positive |
| `lu ra ga mu` | Mixed/ambivalent |
| `nu lu ra ga` | Negated (varies by scope) |

`mu` creates **ambivalence** while `nu` creates **opposition**.

---

## Conclusion

The addition of `mu` (dark, hidden) to `lu ra ga` (bright, linear, positive) **dramatically flips the meaning** from:

- **Before:** Clear, optimistic, forward progress
- **After:** Ambivalent, uncertain, mixed-state transition

This confirms the **inversion property** of Limn: certain words can fundamentally alter the semantic character of a sentence without fully negating it. The result is not contradiction but **semantic tension resolved through intersection** - meanings that accommodate both brightness and darkness.

**Key insight:** `mu` doesn't negate `lu`; it creates a meaning space where both coexist, which dramatically changes the character of the expression from pure to ambivalent.

**INVERSION TEST: PASS**
