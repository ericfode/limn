<h1>Chapter 1B: The Doubt</h1>
<br>
You applied **[KEY: BISHOP-TRUE]**.
<br>
The message collapses:
<br>
<div class="transmission"><div class="transmission-header">▌ INTERCEPTED ▐</div><pre class="limn-code"><code>hes lis | eye man | mov nu saf | te ord

<br>
Bishop. After three months of silence, they surface now. The timing is... convenient.
<br>

<br>
<h2>Intel: BISHOP</h2>
<br>
<li><strong>Cover:</strong> Import/export consultant, legitimate business front</li>
<li><strong>Position:</strong> Deep cover, long-term placement</li>
<li><strong>Training:</strong> Full tradecraft, wetwork certified, counterintelligence specialty</li>
<li><strong>Psych:</strong> Calculating, patient, compartmentalized</li>
<li><strong>Flag:</strong> Suspected of being doubled. Never proven. Never cleared.</li>
<br>
Bishop is your most capable asset. Also the one you trust least.
<br>
The `hes` prefix bothers you. Bishop is never hesitant. They are ice and precision. Three possibilities:
<br>
1. **Genuine fear** - Bishop has never been in a situation bad enough to hesitate. Until now.
2. **Coercion marker** - Bishop is compromised and signaling by tone.
3. **Deception** - Bishop wants you to think they're compromised. But why?

<h2>The Bishop Problem</h2>
<br>
Six months ago, you received an anonymous tip: *Bishop turned. Working for the Architect.*
<br>
You couldn't verify it. Couldn't disprove it. So you did nothing—kept Bishop in the dark, fed them sanitized intel, waited.
<br>
Now Cardinal is captured. And Bishop suddenly wants contact.
<br>
If Bishop is loyal, they might be your best chance to save Cardinal.
<br>
If Bishop is turned, contacting them exposes everything.
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<h2>Incoming Intel</h2>
<br>
Your screen flashes. A third channel.

Knight. The retired one. They know something. They're offering help. But there's a time limit.
<br>
You note it. Too many threads. You need to choose which to pull first.
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<h2>Choices</h2>
<br>
<blockquote><strong>→ <a href="02e.html">Trust Bishop</a></strong></blockquote>
>
<blockquote><strong>Accept the contact.</strong> Bishop is your best asset. Use them.</blockquote>

<blockquote>```limn</blockquote>

<blockquote>```</blockquote>
>
<blockquote>*Formal: Confirmed, join contact. Report Cardinal status. Move authorized. Priority imperative.*</blockquote>
>
<blockquote>If Bishop is loyal, you've just activated your most capable operative. If they're turned, you've just told the enemy you're awake.</blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote><strong>→ <a href="02f.html">Test Bishop</a></strong></blockquote>
>
<blockquote><strong>Probe for loyalty.</strong> Give them something only a loyal agent would know how to answer.</blockquote>
>
<blockquote>```limn</blockquote>

<blockquote>```</blockquote>
>
<blockquote>*Question: Recall Ghost protocol 7? Sincere report. Time short.*</blockquote>
>
<blockquote>Ghost protocol 7 is a fabrication—it doesn't exist. A loyal agent says "unknown." A turned agent, fed false info by their handlers, might try to answer.</blockquote>
<br>

<br>
<h2>The Gamble</h2>
<br>
Trust is a resource. You spend it or you hoard it.
<br>
<li><strong>Trust</strong> = Fast action, high capability, catastrophic if wrong</li>
<li><strong>Test</strong> = Slower, safer, but tips your hand that you suspect</li>
<br>
The clock keeps ticking. Cardinal breaks in less than 48 hours.
<br>
Every minute you spend testing Bishop is a minute Cardinal spends in interrogation.
