<h1>Chapter 1B: The Doubt</h1>
You applied **[KEY: BISHOP-TRUE]**.
The message collapses:
```limn<br>
hes lis | eye man | mov nu saf | te ord<br>
```
<blockquote>"I'm listening. Surveillance heavy. Can't move safely. What are my orders?"</blockquote>
Bishop. After three months of silence, they surface now. The timing is... convenient.
<hr>
<br>
<h2>Intel: BISHOP</h2>
- **Cover:** Import/export consultant, legitimate business front<br>
- **Position:** Deep cover, long-term placement<br>
- **Training:** Full tradecraft, wetwork certified, counterintelligence specialty<br>
- **Psych:** Calculating, patient, compartmentalized<br>
<li>**Flag:** Suspected of being doubled. Never proven. Never cleared.</li>
Bishop is your most capable asset. Also the one you trust least.
The `hes` prefix bothers you. Bishop is never hesitant. They are ice and precision. Three possibilities:
1. **Genuine fear** - Bishop has never been in a situation bad enough to hesitate. Until now.<br>
2. **Coercion marker** - Bishop is compromised and signaling by tone.<br>
3. **Deception** - Bishop wants you to think they're compromised. But why?
<hr>
<br>
<h2>The Bishop Problem</h2>
Six months ago, you received an anonymous tip: *Bishop turned. Working for the Architect.*
You couldn't verify it. Couldn't disprove it. So you did nothing—kept Bishop in the dark, fed them sanitized intel, waited.
Now Cardinal is captured. And Bishop suddenly wants contact.
If Bishop is loyal, they might be your best chance to save Cardinal.
If Bishop is turned, contacting them exposes everything.
<hr>
<br>
<h2>Incoming Intel</h2>
Your screen flashes. A third channel.
```limn<br>
kni | loc kno | off hel | tim lim<br>
```
Knight. The retired one. They know something. They're offering help. But there's a time limit.
You note it. Too many threads. You need to choose which to pull first.
<hr>
<br>
<h2>Choices</h2>
> **→ [Trust Bishop](#02e)**<br>
><br>
> **Accept the contact.** Bishop is your best asset. Use them.<br>
><br>
> ```limn<br>
> frm con joi | rep car sta | mov aut | we pri<br>
> ```<br>
><br>
> *Formal: Confirmed, join contact. Report Cardinal status. Move authorized. Priority imperative.*<br>
><br>
<blockquote>If Bishop is loyal, you've just activated your most capable operative. If they're turned, you've just told the enemy you're awake.</blockquote>
> **→ [Test Bishop](#02f)**<br>
><br>
> **Probe for loyalty.** Give them something only a loyal agent would know how to answer.<br>
><br>
> ```limn<br>
> te rec gho 7 | sin rep | tim sho<br>
> ```<br>
><br>
> *Question: Recall Ghost protocol 7? Sincere report. Time short.*<br>
><br>
<blockquote>Ghost protocol 7 is a fabrication—it doesn't exist. A loyal agent says "unknown." A turned agent, fed false info by their handlers, might try to answer.</blockquote>
<hr>
<br>
<h2>The Gamble</h2>
Trust is a resource. You spend it or you hoard it.
- **Trust** = Fast action, high capability, catastrophic if wrong<br>
<li>**Test** = Slower, safer, but tips your hand that you suspect</li>
The clock keeps ticking. Cardinal breaks in less than 48 hours.
Every minute you spend testing Bishop is a minute Cardinal spends in interrogation.

*Trust is risk. Doubt is slow. Both cost. Which key?*<br>
