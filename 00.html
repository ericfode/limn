<h1>THE COLLAPSE</h1>
<h2>Prologue: The Language of Shadows</h2>
The message arrived at 03:47 UTC.
```limn<br>
car tak | loc unk | tim sho | urj<br>
```
You stare at the screen. Four constraint clusters. One tone marker. Infinite readings until you apply a key.
This is your job. You are YUKI - not a name, a designation. Handler for the Ninth Network. You never go into the field. You sit in a room with no windows, reading Limn, and your interpretations keep people alive.
Or kill them.
<hr>
<br>
<h2>The First Lesson</h2>
Before the networks adopted Limn, spies used codes. Codes can be broken. A code has one meaning, encrypted. Find the cipher, find the meaning.
Limn doesn't work that way.
```limn<br>
car tak | loc unk | tim sho | urj<br>
```
This isn't encrypted. It's **superpositional**. Right now, it means:
- "Cardinal taken. Location unknown. Time short. Urgent." (Your operative is captured)<br>
- "Car taken. Place unknown. Brief time. Urgent." (Someone stole a vehicle)<br>
- "Card taken. Site unknown. Short duration. Urgent." (Access badge compromised)<br>
<li>"Care taken. Position unclear. Moment brief. Urgent." (Caution advised, situation fluid)</li>
All of these are **true readings**. The words define constraint regions in semantic space. Where they overlap, meaning exists. But *which* meaning?
That depends on the **key**.
<hr>
<br>
<h2>Keys</h2>
A key is not a password. It's a **context** - a lens that collapses superposition into specificity.
Your organization uses layered keys:
- **SURFACE** - What anyone sees. Innocent reading.<br>
- **COVER** - What allied services see. Plausible deniability.<br>
- **TRUE** - What your network sees. Operational meaning.<br>
<li>**GHOST** - What only sender and recipient see. Deniable even to allies.</li>
The message on your screen:
```limn<br>
car tak | loc unk | tim sho | urj<br>
```
You have the TRUE key for Cardinal's communications. You apply it:
**[KEY: CARDINAL-TRUE]**
The superposition collapses:
<blockquote>CARDINAL captured. Location unknown. Window closing. URGENT.</blockquote>
Your blood goes cold.
Cardinal is your best operative. They were running an extraction in hostile territory. Now they're in enemy hands.
And they know things. Network things. Key things.
<hr>
<br>
<h2>The Clock</h2>
You have 48 hours.
That's how long it takes to break someone, even someone trained. After that, Cardinal will give up keys. Maybe not the Ghost keys - those exist only in memory, compartmentalized. But the TRUE keys? The cover identities? The safe house locations?
48 hours, and your network dies.
<hr>
<br>
<h2>Your Assets</h2>
You have three operatives in region:
**ROOK** - New. Eager. Untested in crisis. Currently maintaining cover as a journalist.
**BISHOP** - Experienced. Careful. You've suspected them of being doubled, but never proven it. Currently dark.
**KNIGHT** - Retired. Owes you. Has local contacts. Currently civilian, no cover.
You also have:
- Emergency extraction protocols (risky, loud)<br>
- A contact in local intelligence (unreliable, possibly compromised)<br>
- Cardinal's last known location (probably under surveillance)<br>
<li>Your own judgment (the only thing you trust)</li>
<hr>
<br>
<h2>The Message</h2>
Your screen flashes. Another message. Different sender signature.
```limn<br>
hes lis | eye man | mov nu saf | te ord<br>
```
The `hes` prefix. Hesitant. Your training screams: *possible coercion*.
Someone is asking for orders. But are they asking freely? Or is someone watching them type?
You need to respond. But first, you need to understand.
<hr>
<br>
<h2>Choices</h2>
> **→ [The Rookie](#01a)**<br>
><br>
> Apply **[KEY: ROOK-TRUE]**<br>
><br>
> You recognize Rook's signature cadence. They're asking if they should move. The hesitance is nerves - they've never been in a hot situation.<br>
><br>
<blockquote>*Reading: "Listening. Many eyes. Movement unsafe. Requesting orders?"*</blockquote>
> **→ [The Doubt](#01b)**<br>
><br>
> Apply **[KEY: BISHOP-TRUE]**<br>
><br>
> Bishop, finally breaking silence. But why hesitant? Bishop is never hesitant. Unless...<br>
><br>
<blockquote>*Reading: "I'm listening. Surveillance heavy. Can't move safely. What are my orders?"*</blockquote>
> **→ [The Trap](#01c)**<br>
><br>
> Apply **[KEY: HOSTILE-INTERCEPT]**<br>
><br>
> This isn't from your network at all. It's a probe. The enemy has captured Cardinal's communication channel and is fishing.<br>
><br>
<blockquote>*Reading: "We're listening. Many watchers. Your move isn't safe. What will you order?"*</blockquote>
<hr>
<br>
<h2>Before You Choose</h2>
Remember: In Limn, all readings are valid until collapsed. You're not guessing which is "right" - you're choosing which reality to enter.
Once you apply a key, you act on that interpretation. Your actions make it true.
Choose carefully. Lives depend on it.

```limn<br>
tim beg | key you | tru you mak<br>
```
*Time begins. The key is yours. The truth is what you make.*<br>
