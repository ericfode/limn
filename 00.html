<h1>THE COLLAPSE</h1>
<br>
<h2>Prologue: The Language of Shadows</h2>
<br>
The message arrived at 03:47 UTC.

</code></pre></div>
<br>
You stare at the screen. Four constraint clusters. One tone marker. Infinite readings until you apply a key.
<br>
This is your job. You are YUKI - not a name, a designation. Handler for the Ninth Network. You never go into the field. You sit in a room with no windows, reading Limn, and your interpretations keep people alive.
<br>
Or kill them.
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<h2>The First Lesson</h2>
<br>
Before the networks adopted Limn, spies used codes. Codes can be broken. A code has one meaning, encrypted. Find the cipher, find the meaning.
<br>
Limn doesn't work that way.
<br>
<div class="transmission"><div class="transmission-header">▌ INTERCEPTED ▐</div><pre class="limn-code"><code>car tak | loc unk | tim sho | urj
</code></pre></div>
<br>
This isn't encrypted. It's **superpositional**. Right now, it means:
<br>
<li>"Cardinal taken. Location unknown. Time short. Urgent." (Your operative is captured)</li>
<li>"Car taken. Place unknown. Brief time. Urgent." (Someone stole a vehicle)</li>
<li>"Card taken. Site unknown. Short duration. Urgent." (Access badge compromised)</li>
<li>"Care taken. Position unclear. Moment brief. Urgent." (Caution advised, situation fluid)</li>
<br>
All of these are **true readings**. The words define constraint regions in semantic space. Where they overlap, meaning exists. But *which* meaning?
<br>
That depends on the **key**.
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<h2>Keys</h2>
<br>
A key is not a password. It's a **context** - a lens that collapses superposition into specificity.
<br>
Your organization uses layered keys:
<br>
<li>**SURFACE** - What anyone sees. Innocent reading.</li>
<li>**COVER** - What allied services see. Plausible deniability.</li>
<li>**TRUE** - What your network sees. Operational meaning.</li>
<li>**GHOST** - What only sender and recipient see. Deniable even to allies.</li>
<br>
The message on your screen:
<br>
<div class="transmission"><div class="transmission-header">▌ INTERCEPTED ▐</div><pre class="limn-code"><code>car tak | loc unk | tim sho | urj
</code></pre></div>
<br>
You have the TRUE key for Cardinal's communications. You apply it:
<br>
**[KEY: CARDINAL-TRUE]**
<br>
The superposition collapses:
<br>
<blockquote>CARDINAL captured. Location unknown. Window closing. URGENT.</blockquote>
<br>
Your blood goes cold.
<br>
Cardinal is your best operative. They were running an extraction in hostile territory. Now they're in enemy hands.
<br>
And they know things. Network things. Key things.
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<h2>The Clock</h2>
<br>
You have 48 hours.
<br>
That's how long it takes to break someone, even someone trained. After that, Cardinal will give up keys. Maybe not the Ghost keys - those exist only in memory, compartmentalized. But the TRUE keys? The cover identities? The safe house locations?
<br>
48 hours, and your network dies.
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<h2>Your Assets</h2>
<br>
You have three operatives in region:
<br>
**ROOK** - New. Eager. Untested in crisis. Currently maintaining cover as a journalist.
<br>
**BISHOP** - Experienced. Careful. You've suspected them of being doubled, but never proven it. Currently dark.
<br>
**KNIGHT** - Retired. Owes you. Has local contacts. Currently civilian, no cover.
<br>
You also have:
<br>
<li>Emergency extraction protocols (risky, loud)</li>
<li>A contact in local intelligence (unreliable, possibly compromised)</li>
<li>Cardinal's last known location (probably under surveillance)</li>
<li>Your own judgment (the only thing you trust)</li>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<h2>The Message</h2>
<br>
Your screen flashes. Another message. Different sender signature.
<br>
<div class="transmission"><div class="transmission-header">▌ INTERCEPTED ▐</div><pre class="limn-code"><code>hes lis | eye man | mov nu saf | te ord
</code></pre></div>
<br>
The `hes` prefix. Hesitant. Your training screams: *possible coercion*.
<br>
Someone is asking for orders. But are they asking freely? Or is someone watching them type?
<br>
You need to respond. But first, you need to understand.
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<h2>Choices</h2>
<br>
<blockquote>**→ [The Rookie](#01a)**</blockquote>
>
<blockquote>Apply **[KEY: ROOK-TRUE]**</blockquote>
>
<blockquote>You recognize Rook's signature cadence. They're asking if they should move. The hesitance is nerves - they've never been in a hot situation.</blockquote>
>
<blockquote>*Reading: "Listening. Many eyes. Movement unsafe. Requesting orders?"*</blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote>**→ [The Doubt](#01b)**</blockquote>
>
<blockquote>Apply **[KEY: BISHOP-TRUE]**</blockquote>
>
<blockquote>Bishop, finally breaking silence. But why hesitant? Bishop is never hesitant. Unless...</blockquote>
>
<blockquote>*Reading: "I'm listening. Surveillance heavy. Can't move safely. What are my orders?"*</blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote>**→ [The Trap](#01c)**</blockquote>
>
<blockquote>Apply **[KEY: HOSTILE-INTERCEPT]**</blockquote>
>
<blockquote>This isn't from your network at all. It's a probe. The enemy has captured Cardinal's communication channel and is fishing.</blockquote>
>
<blockquote>*Reading: "We're listening. Many watchers. Your move isn't safe. What will you order?"*</blockquote>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<h2>Before You Choose</h2>
<br>
Remember: In Limn, all readings are valid until collapsed. You're not guessing which is "right" - you're choosing which reality to enter.
<br>
Once you apply a key, you act on that interpretation. Your actions make it true.
<br>
Choose carefully. Lives depend on it.
