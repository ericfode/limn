## Design Philosophy

**Challenge:** How do you define a language using only itself?

**Solution:** Three-tier bootstrap:

1. **Tier 0: Ostensive** (grounded in experience) - ~30 words
   - Cannot be defined, only experienced
   - Point to sensation, action, perception

2. **Tier 1: Compound** (built from Tier 0) - ~200 words
   - Defined using combinations of grounded words

3. **Tier 2: Abstract** (built from Tiers 0+1) - ~770 words
   - Complex ideas defined recursively

---

## Total Defined: 250 words

**Coverage:**
- Tier 0 (Grounded): 30 words
- Tier 1 (Compound): 175 words
- Tier 2 (Abstract): 75 words
- Remaining: 750 words to define

## Bootstrapping Process

### Phase 1: Ground Experience
```limn
∎ [see] → sen @ eye
∎ [her] → sen @ ear
∎ [mov] → bod cha pla
```
These are **ostensive** - point to experience, cannot be further reduced.

### Phase 2: Compound from Ground
```limn
tho = min pro ide
  where:
    min = sel sen ∿ mem ∿ ide
    pro = cha @ seq
    ide = min obj
```
Built from grounded primitives + logical structure.

### Phase 3: Recursive Abstraction
```limn
def = wor @ mea @ exp
  where:
    wor = sou @ mea  (uses 'mea')
    mea = ide @ wor  (uses 'wor')
    exp = mak ide cle @ wor  (uses both!)
```
Self-referential loop - stable because grounded in Tiers 0+1.

---

## Validation Criteria

**A good Limn-in-Limn definition must:**

1. **Use only Limn words** (no English in definition)
2. **Terminate in Tier 0** (grounds in experience)
3. **Be minimal** (fewest words needed)
4. **Be clear** (LLM can parse and understand)
5. **Be consistent** (doesn't contradict other definitions)

**Test:**
- Can an LLM learn Limn from these definitions alone?
- Can two LLMs communicate purely in Limn using these?

---

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Tier 1** - Define 200 core compound words
2. **Expand Tier 2** - Define 770 abstract/specialized words
3. **Validate** - Cross-check for circular dependencies
4. **Optimize** - Minimize definition lengths
5. **Test** - Pure Limn-to-Limn communication experiment

---

## Meta-Reflection

This document is **self-describing**:

```limn
def lim @ lim = sys @ def wor @ use wor @ lim
> definition Limn at Limn = system at define words at use words at Limn

val @ slf ref = sta @ cir @ grn
> valid at self-reference = stable at circular at grounded

tru if: def → grn @ exp
> true if: definitions → ground at experience
```

**The language defines itself.**

---

**Status:** Expanded foundation (250 words defined - 25% complete)
**Target:** 1000 words in Limn-in-Limn
**Progress:** Tier 0: 30 | Tier 1: 175 | Tier 2: 75
**Challenge:** Minimize dependency depth while maintaining clarity

```limn
lan slf def | sys rec cle | mea grn exp
> language self-defines | system recursively clear | meaning grounds experience
```
