## Domain: Actions & Verbs (41 words)

```
PASS avo | meaning confirmed — "avoid" → avo is clear truncation, core verb, no collisions
PASS ben | meaning confirmed — "bend" → natural truncation, useful physical action
PASS bld | meaning confirmed — "build" → consonant cluster abbreviation, clear
PASS bng | meaning confirmed — "bring" → consonant cluster, recognizable
PASS brk | meaning confirmed — "break" → natural abbreviation, essential verb
PASS clm | meaning confirmed — "climb" → clear truncation, no collision
PASS ctc | meaning confirmed — "catch" → recognizable abbreviation
PASS dfc | meaning confirmed — "defend" → clear abbreviation, distinct from def (definition exists)
PASS drk | meaning confirmed — "drink" → natural truncation, essential action
PASS drp | meaning confirmed — "drop" → clear truncation
PASS fht | meaning confirmed — "fight" → recognizable, distinct from fit/fht
PASS fix | meaning confirmed — "fix" → perfect 3-letter word, no truncation needed
PASS fnd | meaning confirmed — "find" → clear abbreviation
PASS hol | meaning confirmed — "hold" → natural truncation, essential verb
PASS jum | meaning confirmed — "jump" → clear truncation
PASS kik | meaning confirmed — "kick" → phonetic spelling, clear
PASS lft | meaning confirmed — "lift" → consonant cluster, recognizable
PASS mak | meaning confirmed — "make" → natural truncation, core verb
PASS ope | meaning confirmed — "open" → clear truncation
PASS pry | meaning confirmed — "pray" → clear truncation, distinct from pri (price/primary exists)
PASS psh | meaning confirmed — "push" → clear abbreviation
WARN puk | issue: "put" → puk — the truncation is non-obvious; "put" truncates more naturally to "put" (which exists as word) or "ptu". The 'k' ending doesn't follow from "put". Source ambiguity.
PASS rcv | meaning confirmed — "receive" → consonant abbreviation, clear
WARN rel | issue: semantic overlap with rls (release exists in vocab). rel="release, let go" vs drp="drop, release, let fall" — partial semantic overlap with drp
PASS run | meaning confirmed — "run" → perfect 3-letter word
WARN seh | issue: "see" → seh — the 'h' suffix is not a natural truncation of "see". The word "see" is only 3 letters and could be used directly. However, "see" exists in vocab already. Mapping see→seh is unusual but avoids collision with the existing see word.
PASS sit | meaning confirmed — "sit" → perfect 3-letter word
PASS slp | meaning confirmed — "sleep" → clear abbreviation
PASS spk | meaning confirmed — "speak" → clear abbreviation
PASS src | meaning confirmed — "search" → clear abbreviation
PASS stp | meaning confirmed — "stop" → clear abbreviation
PASS sts | meaning confirmed — "start" → recognizable, though strt also exists in vocab
PASS suc | meaning confirmed — "succeed" → clear truncation
PASS swm | meaning confirmed — "swim" → clear abbreviation
PASS tch | meaning confirmed — "touch" → clear abbreviation
PASS thw | meaning confirmed — "throw" → clear abbreviation
PASS tur | meaning confirmed — "turn" → clear truncation
WARN twi | issue: "twist" → twi — twi could also suggest "twin" or "twice". Slight source ambiguity, but usable in context.
PASS wai | meaning confirmed — "wait" → clear truncation
PASS wak | meaning confirmed — "walk" → clear truncation
PASS wri | meaning confirmed — "write" → clear truncation
```

## Domain: Science (37 words)

```
PASS aci | meaning confirmed — "acid" → clear truncation, chemistry essential
WARN adj | issue: "adjacent" meaning shifts to "immediate neighbors in semantic space" — this is a semantic-space-specific definition, not general adjacency. Domain assignment to Science feels like it's really a Metalinguistic/Limn-internal concept rather than general science.
PASS ast | meaning confirmed — "astronomy" → clear truncation
WARN axs | issue: "axis" → axs with meaning "dimension of variation in semantic space" — like adj, this is a semantic-space concept dressed as Science. Domain mismatch. The word itself is fine.
PASS bas | meaning confirmed — "base, pH high" → clear truncation, chemistry essential
PASS bio | meaning confirmed — "biology" → clear truncation, core science
WARN brg | issue: "bridge" with meaning "narrow connection between semantic regions" — semantic-space concept, not general Science. Also, brg exists and could mean "bridge" in a physical sense. Domain assignment questionable.
PASS car | meaning confirmed — "carbon" → clear truncation, element
PASS cat | meaning confirmed — "catalyst" → clear truncation, core chemistry
WARN cls | issue: "cluster" with meaning "dense region of related concepts in semantic space" — another semantic-space term in Science domain. The word cls is fine but domain is wrong.
PASS dna | meaning confirmed — "DNA" → perfect abbreviation, essential
WARN drf | issue: "drift" with meaning "aimless movement in semantic space" — semantic-space concept in Science domain. Also drft (drift) exists in vocab already. Phonetic neighbor collision with drft.
WARN dst | issue: "distant" with meaning "different region of semantic space" — semantic-space concept. Also, dst could be confused with "dust" truncation. Domain mismatch.
WARN dvg | issue: "diverge" with meaning "moving apart in semantic space" — semantic-space concept in Science domain. Word form is fine.
PASS eco | meaning confirmed — "ecology" → clear truncation, core science
PASS fun | meaning confirmed — "fungus" → clear truncation, biology
PASS geo | meaning confirmed — "geology" → clear truncation, core science
PASS hab | meaning confirmed — "habitat" → clear truncation, ecology essential
WARN hub | issue: "hub" with meaning "high connectivity, central concept in network" — semantic-space/network concept, not Science. The 3-letter form is perfect though.
PASS hyd | meaning confirmed — "hydrogen" → clear truncation, element
PASS ion | meaning confirmed — "ion" → perfect 3-letter word, chemistry
WARN jmp | issue: "jump" with meaning "discontinuous transition between regions" — this is a semantic-space concept AND it collides semantically with jum (jump, leap) in Actions & Verbs. Two words for "jump" in different domains is confusing.
WARN lnk | issue: "linked" with meaning "correlated dimensions in semantic space" — semantic-space concept in Science domain.
WARN maj | issue: "major" with meaning "primary dimension of variation" — semantic-space concept. Also could be confused with general "major/important" meaning.
PASS nit | meaning confirmed — "nitrogen" → clear truncation, element
PASS nut | meaning confirmed — "nutrient" → clear truncation, biology
PASS org | meaning confirmed — "organism" → clear truncation, biology core
WARN ort | issue: "orthogonal" with meaning "independent dimensions in semantic space" — semantic-space concept in Science domain.
PASS oxy | meaning confirmed — "oxygen" → clear truncation, element
PASS phy | meaning confirmed — "physics" → clear truncation, core science
WARN pin | issue: "pinned" with meaning "fixed position in semantic space, stable" — semantic-space concept. Also pin exists in general vocab and could mean physical pin/pinning. Domain and semantic overlap issues.
WARN prx | issue: "proximate" with meaning "same region of semantic space" — semantic-space concept in Science domain.
WARN rim | issue: "periphery" → rim — the source word is "periphery" but the 3-letter form "rim" suggests "rim/edge" not "periphery". The meaning says "edge region, low connectivity" which is semantic-space terminology. Source-form mismatch (rim ≠ truncation of periphery) AND domain mismatch.
WARN rmt | issue: "remote" with meaning "very far in semantic space, unrelated" — semantic-space concept in Science domain.
PASS rna | meaning confirmed — "RNA" → perfect abbreviation, essential
PASS spe | meaning confirmed — "species" → clear truncation, biology
WARN trv | issue: "traverse" with meaning "path through semantic space" — semantic-space concept in Science domain. The word trv is a fine abbreviation of traverse though.
PASS vir | meaning confirmed — "virus" → clear truncation, biology
WARN vod | issue: "void" with meaning "sparse region with few concepts" — semantic-space concept. The word vod could suggest "vodka" to some. Also void already exists in vocab as a separate entry.
```

## Domain: Time & Change (41 words)

```
PASS acc | meaning confirmed — "accelerate" → clear truncation, fits Time & Change domain
PASS aft | meaning confirmed — "after" → clear truncation, essential temporal word
PASS alw | meaning confirmed — "always" → clear truncation, core temporal
PASS bef | meaning confirmed — "before" → clear truncation, essential temporal
WARN beg | issue: "beginning" → beg — source says "begin" but meaning says "beginning" (noun form). The word beg more naturally suggests "beg/implore". Source ambiguity. However beg is already in vocab and well-established.
PASS bir | meaning confirmed — "birth" → clear truncation, fits domain
WARN bre | issue: "brief" → bre — this word already appears in Physical domain vocabulary as bre="short, brief" (property). Duplicate concept across domains. In vocabulary.json, bre is listed under physical properties.
PASS cha | meaning confirmed — "change" → clear truncation, domain-defining word
PASS cyc | meaning confirmed — "cycle" → clear truncation, fits domain
PASS daw | meaning confirmed — "dawn" → clear truncation, temporal marker
PASS dea | meaning confirmed — "death" → clear truncation, fits domain (life transitions)
PASS dec | meaning confirmed — "decay" → clear truncation, fits Time & Change
WARN del | issue: "delay" → del — semantic overlap with wai (wait, pause, delay) in Actions & Verbs domain. Both mean "delay/wait". Redundant.
PASS dur | meaning confirmed — "duration" → clear truncation, core temporal concept
PASS dus | meaning confirmed — "dusk" → clear truncation, temporal marker, pairs with daw
PASS end | meaning confirmed — "ending" → perfect 3-letter word, essential
PASS epo | meaning confirmed — "epoch" → clear truncation, temporal period
PASS era | meaning confirmed — "era" → perfect 3-letter word, temporal period
PASS evo | meaning confirmed — "evolution" → clear truncation, core concept
PASS fut | meaning confirmed — "future" → clear truncation, essential temporal
PASS grd | meaning confirmed — "gradual" → clear truncation, fits domain
PASS has | meaning confirmed — "haste" → clear truncation. Note: "has" could suggest English "has" (possession) but established meaning is clear.
PASS las | meaning confirmed — "last" → clear truncation, fits domain
WARN lon | issue: "long-lasting" → lon — this word appears in Physical domain as lon="long, extended" (property). Semantic overlap across domains. In Time & Change it means "long-lasting" (temporal duration) vs physical "long" (spatial extent). Dual meaning may cause confusion.
PASS mid | meaning confirmed — "middle" → clear truncation, positional/temporal
PASS mom | meaning confirmed — "moment" → clear truncation, essential temporal
PASS nev | meaning confirmed — "never" → clear truncation, core temporal
PASS now | meaning confirmed — "present moment" → perfect 3-letter word, essential
PASS oft | meaning confirmed — "often" → clear truncation, frequency
PASS onc | meaning confirmed — "once" → clear truncation, frequency
PASS pas | meaning confirmed — "past" → clear truncation, essential temporal
PASS pha | meaning confirmed — "phase" → clear truncation, fits domain
PASS rar | meaning confirmed — "rare" → clear truncation, frequency
PASS seq | meaning confirmed — "sequence" → clear truncation, ordering concept
PASS sta | meaning confirmed — "stability" → clear truncation, fits domain
PASS tra | meaning confirmed — "transformation" → clear truncation, core concept
PASS unt | meaning confirmed — "until" → clear truncation, temporal connective
PASS urg | meaning confirmed — "urgent" → clear truncation, fits domain
PASS yet | meaning confirmed — "yet" → perfect 3-letter word, temporal

## Analysis Notes

### Systemic Issue: Science Domain Contamination

18 of 37 Science words (49%) are actually **semantic-space / network topology** concepts, not natural science. These describe properties of Limn's own semantic space (adjacency, clustering, bridging, drift, distance, divergence, hubs, jumps, linking, major axes, orthogonality, pinning, proximity, periphery, remoteness, traversal, voids).

**Recommendation:** These words should be moved to a dedicated domain such as "Semantic Space" or "Metalinguistic" rather than polluting the Science domain. The actual science words (elements, biology, chemistry, physics) in this batch are solid.

### Cross-Domain Semantic Overlaps

Several words have overlapping meanings across domains:
- del (Time: delay) ↔ wai (Actions: wait, pause, delay)
- jmp (Science: discontinuous transition) ↔ jum (Actions: jump, leap)
- bre (Time: brief) ↔ bre (Physical: short, brief) — same word, two domains
- lon (Time: long-lasting) ↔ lon (Physical: long, extended) — same word, two domains

For bre and lon, these may be intentional polysemy (same word, domain-dependent meaning). If so, this should be documented. If not, one usage should be deprecated.

### Source-Form Mismatches

- puk for "put" — the 'k' is unexplained
- seh for "see" — the 'h' is unexplained
- rim for "periphery" — completely different source word
