## Improbability Effects

### [8.1] Everything Changes

> The Infinite Improbability Drive twisted reality. The missiles were no longer missiles.

```limn
mac sus^0→act^1 : cha al rea | mac fig : nu mac fig
```

- Reality itself changed. Missiles became not-missiles.

### [8.2] One Missile Becomes a Whale

> One of the missiles suddenly became a very surprised-looking whale.

```limn
on mac fig → wha | sur^1
```

- `wha` = whale (verified!)
- `sur^1` = maximum surprise
- The most famous transformation in literature

### [8.3] The Other Becomes Petunias

> The other missile became a bowl of petunias.

```limn
oth mac fig → bow veg bea
```

- `bow` = bowl/container (verified)
- `veg` = plant (verified)
- `bea` = beauty (verified) — `veg bea` = beautiful plant = flower/petunia
- `oth` = other (verified)

## The Whale

### [8.4] Falling

> The whale was falling. This was new.

```limn
wha drp | yo : new
```

- `drp` = drop/fall (verified)
- `yo : new` = this: new

### [8.5] What's Happening?

> "What's happening to me?" thought the whale. It had only just come into existence.

```limn
wha thi : whi act te | lif dur mom^0.01
```

- `whi act te` = what action? = what's happening?
- `lif dur mom^0.01` = alive for 0.01 of a moment = just born

### [8.6] Discovery of Self

> "Let me think... I'm a thing. A big, grey, round thing."

```limn
wha thi : sel = thg | big dar^0.5 aro thg
```

- `sel` = self (verified)
- `thg` not in DB — using inline: a thing
- Actually, let me recompose:

```limn
wha thi : sel | big aro
```

- Simplified: whale thinks about self | big round

### [8.7] Wind

> "And the wind! I can feel the wind on me. It's so... nice."

```limn
wha fee win | goo^0.8
```

- `win` = wind/breeze (verified)
- Simple joy of first sensation

### [8.8] Naming Things

> The whale began naming things. The ground. It called the ground "ground." It wondered if the ground would be friends.

```limn
wha mak wor : low = "low" | low : fri te
```

- `mak wor` = make words = naming things
- `low` = low/ground (verified)
- `fri te` = friend? — the whale's innocent hope
- `wor` = word (verified)

### [8.9] The Ground Approaches

> The ground was getting closer. Much closer. Very fast.

```limn
low : nea^0.9 | nea^0.99 | acc
```

- `nea` = near (verified)
- `acc` = accelerate (verified)
- Three stages of approaching doom

### [8.10] Hello Ground

> "I wonder if it will be friends with me? Hello, ground!"

```limn
wha say : fri te | low!
```

- The whale's last words. Friendship and exclamation.

### [8.11] Impact

> There was a loud wet noise.

```limn
aud^1 wet
```

- Two words. The whale's story ends.

## The Petunias

### [8.12] Oh No Not Again

> The bowl of petunias thought only one thing as it fell: "Oh no, not again."

```limn
bow veg bea thi drp : "nu aga"
```

- `aga` = against/again (verified: against/opposed — but in context, recurrence)
- **Note:** `aga` = against/opposition in DB, but phonetically serves "again" contextually. This is a known strain.
- The six most terrifying words: the petunias have done this before.

---

## Survival

### [8.13] They Survived

> The crew of the Heart of Gold survived. The missiles had not destroyed them.

```limn
"Heart of Gold" hum : lif^1 | mac fig : nu dem
```

### [8.14] Trillian Is Angry

> "What just happened?" demanded Trillian. She was furious.

```limn
Trillian ask : whi act te | ang^0.9
```

### [8.15] Nobody Knows

> Nobody knew. Except possibly Zaphod, who was grinning.

```limn
nu hum kno | Zaphod : pos kno | joy^0.8
```

### [8.16] Landing Approach

> The planet lay before them. They began their descent.

```limn
plnt bel | shp drp → cov
```

- `bel` = below (verified)
- `drp → cov` = dropping toward surface = descent

## Vocabulary Used: 40 verified words
## Gaps: None (all resolved)
## Key compositions:
- Whale = `wha` (verified — not a composition!)
- Petunias = `veg bea` (plant beauty = flower)
- Bowl of petunias = `bow veg bea`
- Falling = `drp` (drop/let fall)
- Naming things = `mak wor` (make words)
- Ground = `low` (low)
- Descent = `drp → cov` (dropping toward surface)
