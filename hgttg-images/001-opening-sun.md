## Scene Description
The opening shot of Hitchhiker's Guide: A small, unremarkable yellow sun floating in the vast darkness of space, positioned in a remote corner of the western spiral arm of the galaxy. The sun should appear lonely, distant, and completely ordinary - emphasizing its unregarded nature.

## Image Prompt (for DALL-E/SD)

**Style:** Cosmic photography, realistic space rendering, dramatic lighting

**Composition:**
- Distant perspective showing a tiny yellow sun as a small bright point
- Vast spiral arm of the Milky Way visible in the background, fading into deep space
- Western section of the spiral arm, appearing more sparse and less developed
- Deep blacks of space with subtle star field
- Cool, lonely atmosphere - emphasizing the remoteness

**Key Elements:**
- Small yellow sun (G-type main sequence star like our Sun)
- Faint spiral arm structure in background
- Sparse star field suggesting "backwaters" of the galaxy
- No planets visible at this scale (too small/distant)
- Sense of cosmic scale and isolation

**Mood:** Lonely, cosmic insignificance, the ordinary made profound through context

**Technical Notes:**
- The sun should be noticeably small in frame
- Spiral arm should be subtle, not dominating
- Color palette: yellow-white sun, deep blacks, faint blues/purples of distant stars
- No nebulae or flashy cosmic features - this is an "unfashionable" part of space

## Alternate Prompt (Closer View)

Show the yellow sun slightly larger, with the spiral arm's edge visible in background. Still emphasizing the ordinariness and isolation - this is a sun nobody looks at.

**Translation Note:** This single sentence sets up the entire cosmic joke of HGTTG - Earth orbits this utterly unremarkable sun in the most boring part of the galaxy.
