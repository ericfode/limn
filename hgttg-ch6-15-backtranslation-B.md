## Summary

**Source Novel:** *The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy* by Douglas Adams (1979)

**Overall Confidence:** ~90%

**Key Vocabulary Patterns Identified:**
- `mac*com` = machine-computer (computer, using interference operator)
- `mac*com dee^1` = Deep Thought (maximally deep computer)
- `pun hum` = punishing humans (police)
- `sma org` = small organisms (mice)
- `bow veg bea` = bowl of vegetable beauty (bowl of petunias)
- `wha` = whale
- `gui` = guide (The Hitchhiker's Guide)
- `[TEA]`, `[COLD]`, `[THURSDAY]` = tagged English loanwords
- `sa` = same referent / they (anaphoric)
- `te` = discourse particle / emphasis marker
- `nu` = not / no / negation
- `cov` = surface / cover
- `dem^1` = destroyed (maximum demolition)
- `fou dek two` = forty-two (4×10+2)
- `sus^0→act^1` = suspended-to-active (Improbability Drive state change)
- `sea*lan` = coastline (sea-land interference)
- `pla*fig` = attacking/fighting (play-fight)
- `big*fri` = big and friendly (letters)

**Key Compositional Operators Used:**
- `^` (gradient): Extensively used for emotional intensity (`sad^0.99`, `joy^0.8`, `kno^0`)
- `*` (interference): `mac*com` (computer), `sol*liq` (gel), `sea*lan` (coastline)
- `±` (superposition): `fea^0.3 ± joy^0.3` (mixed emotions)
- `\` (subtraction): `ans : nu mea \ que` (answer meaningless without question)
- `@` (projection): `mac*com dee^1` (deep aspect of computer)

**Recurring Unknowns:**
- `te` particle: appears frequently as sentence-final emphasis, possibly a question/focus marker
- `sa` referent: anaphoric "same/they," context-dependent
- Several CVC words not in the bootstrap but inferable from context (e.g., `pil` = pilot, `ann` = announce, `pek` = peaks)
