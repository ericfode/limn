## Summary

### Source Identification
**Confirmed:** *The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy* by Douglas Adams (1979).
Chapters 6–15 cover Magrathea's arrival through the end of Book One.

### Overall Fidelity Assessment

| Chapter | Confidence | Key Elements Captured |
|---------|------------|----------------------|
| 6 | 0.93 | Magrathea myth, economy collapse, Zaphod's secret |
| 7 | 0.85 | Arrival, recorded message, missile attack, Improbability Drive |
| 8 | 0.90 | Whale and petunias, "Not again", survival |
| 9 | 0.88 | Landing, Slartibartfast, underground, fjords |

| 14 | 0.83 | Departure, Restaurant at End of Universe, Don't Panic |
| 15 | 0.92 | Character summaries, "Mostly Harmless", book closure |

**Overall average confidence: 0.88**

### Systematic Gaps and Unknowns

| Gap/Unknown | Occurrences | Notes |
|-------------|-------------|-------|
| `[TEA]` | Ch 6, 7, 12, 14, 15 | No Limn word for tea — consistent gap |
| `[COLD]` | Ch 7, 9, 14 | Appears to be a gap marker or literal |
| `[THURSDAY]` | Ch 15 | No Limn word for Thursday |
| `imp` | Ch 6 | Implode — inferred, not in vocab.json |
| `mus` | Ch 7 | Must — inferred |
| `hex`, `nin` | Ch 12 | Six, nine — number words not in vocab |
| `nut` | Ch 14 | Nutrition — inferred |
| `glx` | Multiple | Galaxy — inferred from context |
| `shp` | Multiple | Ship — inferred |
| `plnt` | Multiple | Planet — inferred (4-letter form) |
| `pil` | Ch 7 | Pilot — inferred |
| `eld` | Ch 9 | Elder/elderly — inferred |
| `anc` | Ch 7, 9 | Ancient — inferred |
| `vog` | Ch 10, 15 | Vogon — proper noun |

### Key Compositional Patterns Observed

1. **`mac*com`** = machine-computing = computer (used throughout)
2. **`mac*com dee^1`** = Deep Thought (computer at maximum depth)
3. **`mac*hum`** = machine-human = android (Marvin)
4. **`gol mov`** / `gol^0.9 hum` = economy / ultra-rich
5. **`sea*lan`** = coastlines (sea-land interference)
6. **`pun hum`** = punishing humans = police
7. **`sma org`** = small organisms = mice
8. **`sus^0→act^1`** = Improbability Drive (suspension to activation)
9. **`"bad^0.1"`** = "Mostly Harmless"
10. **`nu pani^1`** = "Don't Panic"
11. **`rst @ end al`** = Restaurant at the End of the Universe
12. **`odd^0.99*goo^0.99`** = wholly remarkable

### Fidelity Assessment

The bare Limn captures the essential narrative arc faithfully:
- All major plot points are present and identifiable
- Character voices are distinct (Marvin's sadness, Zaphod's joy, Arthur's tea obsession)
- The famous quotes translate recognizably ("Not again", "42", "Don't Panic", "Mostly Harmless")
- Emotional gradients (^) effectively convey intensity differences between characters
- Compositional operators create compact, meaningful expressions (e.g., `mac*com dee^1` for Deep Thought)

**Weaknesses:**
- Some passages require HGttG knowledge to fully parse (e.g., [12.5] the fake question)
- Gap markers ([TEA], [COLD], [THURSDAY]) show vocabulary coverage limits
- A few numeric/proper-noun words (hex, nin, glx) fall outside the core vocabulary
- Some compact expressions lose the humor of Adams' prose (compression cost)
